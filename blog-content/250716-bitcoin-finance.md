TLDR Bitcoin is a promising, growing and equal-right Ponzi scheme that will likely leave the world a better place than today if it succeeds in dethroning the rotting fiat Ponzi scheme and humanity doesn't get wiped out by a geophysical cataclysm.

# Money is inherently a Ponzi scheme

A Ponzi scheme is defined as (abridged):

`A Ponzi scheme lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.`

Bitcoin, by that definition, is a Ponzi scheme.

Guess what - fiat currency (debt) is also a Ponzi scheme. Debt ("bonds", IOUs) itself is a ponzi scheme. Financial "assets" (debt) are ponzi schemes. What is debt? Debt is a promise of payment in the future. All money is debt, including Bitcoin, and it's also a Ponzi scheme.

Fiat currency is a dying, rotting, Ponzi scheme where certain individuals have unilateral privileges to profit from seignorage.

Bitcoin is a growing Ponzi scheme that offers equal rights to all participants and has the power to dethrone the fiat currency Ponzi schemes in the marketplace of money Ponzi schemes.

Why? It's just better. No one can unilaterally create more Bitcoin for free (seigniorage). It's border-agnostic. It doesn't have to jump through centralized fence-hoops. It's self-custodial. You don't have to pay fees to shareholders of the system as a percentage of your transfered money. All the pro-Bitcoin narratives are indeed true.

Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme that has a genuine power to improve the world, and behind it, are many motivated individuals fighting for a great cause, a better future, and personal gain - a powerful cocktail.

# Can I just sit on Bitcoin and wait for the world to become amazing?

No. Bitcoin alone is insufficient. Be prepared to fight and go to war over Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only succeed through the collective power of determined people.

# Is the Final Parabola (my old Bitcoin thesis) still possible?

Yes, in some future timelines, we are still on track for a legitimate dollar price of infinite dollars per Bitcoin - in other words, a world where dollars will be completely worthless, and no amount of dollars will be exchangeable for any Bitcoin (except perhaps as firewood or recycled paper). This will occur when all people worldwide cease to use the dollar as a store of value and medium of exchange, and instead use Bitcoin.

# Cataclysmic Considerations

In a geophysical cataclysm, money becomes worthless, since money's worth is in part based on future production. The only reason you hold money today is because you expect to be able to exchange it for something valuable in the future. If you don't expect there to be much or any abundance of valuable "things" in the future, then money becomes worthless.

# Money has no intrinsic value

Money is worthless by itself.

What has value is people, stuff, products, services, etc. Money is only useful so long as people are willing to give you their valuable stuff in exchange for it, in the hopes that they themselves will then be able to do the same in the future.

Humans could live without money. They just have to drop the money and grow food, build shelters, work hard, trust each other, and so on everyday.

Money should simply be a means to an end - a tool to help you have a good death, achieve a dream, complete a project, do something important. It should not be the focus of anyone's life.

# Money is a giant Ponzi scheme and today, a tool of enslavement

Yes, you have been convinced to sit quietly and harmlessly and exchange all your labor, time, effort, and stuff for pieces of paper and/or bits in someone else's computer, produced at effectively 0 cost.

Look around you. You are a free human being. You can do whatever you want. That filthy green piece of paper in your hand? You can toss it into the sewer (where it belongs) and nothing around you, including yourself, will change. Actually, the palm of your hand won't have filth on it anymore.

# A Potential Future: History of the 2000 CE Ancient Silicon Age Trans-Atlantic Empire's End-Times (Written 5000 CE by Junho): 

`In the decades before the cataclysm, the masses, who'd been hoodwinked by the magic word spells of law, order, money, and pacifist liberalism, stood idly by, entranced, as their labor and resources continued to be taken away in front of their blind, unsuspecting eyes. "It is ours", the collectors said, "this is the law", as the masses handed over their earnings into the collectors' outstretched hands.`

`Those receiving the tributes and controlling the money printers of the proles used these money spells to extract all the resources from the land and prepare their own secret hideouts. When the cataclysm came, the proles were left to perish helplessly on the surface, as they were viewed as naught more than that. The proles couldn't realize that all they needed to do to survive was to collectively stand up, organize themselves, and take back what was rightfully theirs in the years before the cataclysm, by the natural laws and order of Earth itself, and by their inalienable powers to reshape the world bestowed upon them by their Creator.`

`Instead, in their failure to organize under a common cause, and to see what was occurring before their very eyes and under their feet, they chose to remain captured by the spells of money and liberalism till the very end, perishing after working as cattle for generations. Today, they remain eternal examples of what once was, as fossils under the sea, along with their civilization. Oh, what could've been.`
