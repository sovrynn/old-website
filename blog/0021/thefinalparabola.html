        Welcome to what I believe to be my ultimate endgame Bitcoin thesis -
        The Final Parabola.

          The Final Parabola
        </p>
      </section> 
      <p>
        I'm not sure how long this will take to play out. But I have a feeling
        it will take shape within a decade. Even sooner than that perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what is The Final Parabola?
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a look at the current Bitcoin price chart, on a logarithmic
        scale:
      </p>
      <section>
        <img src="img/BTC price chart.png" alt="BTC price chart">
        <p>
          BTC price chart
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        Notice how the price is shaped like a logarithmic curve?
      </p>
      <section>
        <img src="img/Logarithmic Curve.png" alt="Logarithmic Curve">
        <p>
          Logarithmic Curve
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        Some people use this fact to extrapolate that the future Bitcoin price
        will follow a log curve forever:
      </p>
      <section>
        <img src="img/Bitcoin Log Curve.png" alt="Bitcoin Log Curve">
        <p>
          Bitcoin Log Curve
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        The explanation given for this is typically diminishing returns and
        lengthening cycles. More specifically, that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It becomes more difficult to lift Bitcoin's price higher the higher
          the Bitcoin price is
        </li>
        <li>
          More time is required to drag in the larger amounts of money
          required to lift Bitcoin's price the higher the Bitcoin price is
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, I think the Bitcoin logarithmic curve model only works in the
        short-term, and will be wrong in the long-term. Instead, I think the
        Bitcoin price chart will eventually take this shape:
      </p>
      <section>
        <img src="img/Flipped S-Curve.png" alt="Flipped S-Curve">
        <p>
          Flipped S-Curve
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        I'm not talking about the specific dimensions. I'm simply talking
        about the overall shape. While the logarithmic curve follows
        diminishing returns forever, the flipped S-curve shape I'm showing
        here reaches an inflection point where it turns into a parabola. This
        is what I'm referring to when I say "the final parabola".
      </p>
      <section>
        <img src="img/The Final Parabola Labeled.png" alt="The Final Parabola Labeled">
        <p>
          The Final Parabola Labeled
        </p>
      </section>      
      <p>
        So why do I think we will see a final parabola on the Bitcoin price
        chart?
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, the logarithmic curve model simply doesn't make sense to
        me when it comes to how I think Bitcoin will be adopted by the masses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the price just keeps making smaller and smaller gains over longer
          and longer cycles, that means adoption will get dragged on over
          longer and longer timeframes.
        </li>
        <li>
          But we Bitcoiners all know Bitcoin is a viral, viral idea and that
          once people get it, adoption will spread like wildfire and
          eventually everyone will be selling everything they own to buy
          Bitcoin.
        </li>
        <li>
          Q: So where's that mass hysteria and hype in the Bitcoin logarithmic
          curve price model?
        </li>
        <li>
          A: It ain't there. It doesn't match up.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That's where my idea comes in. The reasoning for my idea begins with
        the adoption S-curve, which refers to the stages of adoption of a new
        product. Notice the inflection point labeled near the bottom of the
        curve in blue:

        <p>
          Adoption S-Curve
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        The S-curve becomes more interesting when we combine it with a
        population distribution of market participants:

      </section>
      <p>
        Currently, I believe we are still in the "Innovators" section of
        Bitcoin adoption as money. Here's some justification for that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          
          <a href="https://twitter.com/Croesus_BTC/status/1622691768826478593?lang=en">
            Total wealth allocation to Bitcoin is not even 1%</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          
          <a href="https://twitter.com/MitchellHODL/status/1675632153797820416">
            Total number of wholecoiners in the world is nowhere close to
            1%</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          No one I personally know has a significant Bitcoin allocation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>
        How is the inflection point related to adoption?
      </h1>
      <p>
        So, what new force am I looking for? I'm looking for the inflection
        point.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inflection point is where the adoption rate suddenly seems to
        change... from gradually, to suddenly. Sound familiar?
      </p>
      <p>
        Take another look at this diagram. Notice how the adoption is really
        slow before the inflection point, but becomes significantly quicker
        after the inflection point?:
      </p>
      <section>
        <img src="img/Adoption Rate Picking Up After Inflection Point.png" alt="Adoption Rate Picking Up After Inflection Point">
        <p>
          Adoption Rate Picking Up After Inflection Point
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        It may have taken a decade just to get through the "Innovators" stage
        and near the inflection point. But the rest of the adoption will
        happen at a much, much faster rate. Such is the parabolic nature of
        the S-curve, and the viral nature of Bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
        What will this force of rapid adoption look like? I know exactly what
        it will look like - mass market euphoria. Animal spirits. Green
        candles. FOMO. That force that we are all so familiar with. The force
        that made all of us FOMO into Bitcoin in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        What will the trigger be for this force to take over the world? Well,
        it turns out that FOMO is actually a self-reinforcing force. It
        started from nothing and created an ever-growing history of repeated
        Bitcoin ATHs. Even left untouched, it will take over the entire world
        on its own. However, a sudden loss of confidence around the world in
        the dollar system could be a catalyst that speeds it up. And in fact,
        a loss of confidence in the dollar system is exactly what motivated
        Satoshi to create Bitcoin. Funny how that works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, regardless of the exact sequence of events, eventually the
        final parabola will happen. We know it'll happen because eventually
        the whole world will realize that they shouldn't have confidence in
        the dollar system. This will lead to the parabola where the whole
        world onboards to Bitcoin by FOMOing into it. The parabola which is
        depicted in the second half of the S-curve.
      </p>
      <h1>
        What does the inflection point look like on the price chart?
      </h1>
      <p>
        I believe the inflection point on the adoption curve is the same as
        the center point on the flipped S-curve shape. To give a complete
        picture, I've made a complete diagram overlaying the flipped S-curve
        shape with the adoption curve:

          The Complete Diagram
        </p>
      </section>          
      <p>
        So far it's been around 14 years since Bitcoin was created. During
        this time, we've been in the left side of the above diagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we may soon enter the right side of the shape. And in fact, we
        may have actually already entered it very recently.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, to put everything together, what does my vision for the eventual
        BTC price chart look like? Well, I can't give exact timeframes, but it
        might look something like this:
      </p>
      <section>
        <img src="img/My Prediction.png" alt="My Prediction">
        <p>
          My Prediction
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        Let me give a specific timeframe prediction. I predict, with 80%
        certainty, that the inflection point is within 1.5 years of today -
        July 4, 2023. The backwards border is determined from Feb 24 2023,
        which is the date when Russia began its SMO to invade Ukraine. This
        ultimately led to the West stealing Russia's forex reserves, making
        the entire world lose confidence in the dollar monetary system. The
        forward border is determined as approximately one year after the
        upcoming March 2024 halvening. Halvenings typically require some time
        to create the parabolas that they usually create. Finally, there are
        also many important events within this range, such as the ongoing US
        banking crisis and the upcoming 2024 US presidential election. So,
        taking all those macro events into account, that's my 3-year range for
        the inflection point with an 80% certainty.
      </p>      
      <h1>
        Closing Thoughts
      </h1>
      <p>
        Bitcoin might just be the most viral product ever created - the
        product of sound money. A product that literally every person on this
        planet desperately needs. I think that means the S-curve and adoption
        rate is going to be ridiculously, ridiculously vertical.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember. Bitcoin started at 0 against the dollar. And the dollar is
        eventually going to 0 against Bitcoin. That's not hyperbole. My idea
        ties those two events together into a harmonious geometric shape on
        the price chart using the idea of the adoption S-curve.
      </p>

        Final notes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Final Parabola will be what people oft refer to as
          hyperbitcoinization
        </li>
        <li>
          The Final Parabola will likely coincide with the fall of the dollar,
          and subsequently, the fall of America's empire
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Let's see what happens - gradually, then suddenly.

        I'm very grateful to all of you. Let's all make The Final Parabola
        happen together and make the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
        One last thing. If you're a Bitcoiner but you sell shitcoins to people
        instead of Bitcoin. You're being dishonest and you're hurting and
        stealing from other people. You should be ashamed of what you're
        doing. Please fix your ways. Luckily for you, it's never too late. And
        FYI, if you truly believe The Final Parabola will happen (which you
        should since you're a Bitcoiner), it's also in your best interest to
        fix your ways ASAP because once The Final Parabola happens, everyone
        will know that you were doing bad things to them and others. And if
        you're an Etherean who is a Bitcoiner at heart, I'm speaking to you as
        well. We all know Bitcoin is the only blockchain-based contender for
        the world's future money and has always been the only such contender.
        If we all work together we can make The Final Parabola happen sooner
        rather than later. And don't we all want it to happen? I think we do.
        I urge you not to lose sight of the original dream. Let's not sabotage
        ourselves, each other, the rest of the world (which desperately needs
        Bitcoin), and Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin needs us. And the world will be 
        a better place once The Final Parabola is finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want The Final Parabola to happen, share this message to
        everyone you know so they all know what is coming. We are the ones who
        will make The Final Parabola happen.
