    Bitcoin has been trading in the same $15k-$30k range for about an year
  and a half now. For the last 6 months, it's been trading between $25k
  and $30k. During this time, I've been able to appreciate what Bitcoin
  is and what it isn't.
   </p>
   <h1>
    Bitcoin is steadfast
   </h1>
   <p>
    Bitcoin is NOT a trade. The Bitcoin thesis of becoming the world's
  future sound money isn't something that's going to play out today, and
  it's not going to play out tomorrow, or in a week, or in a month, or
  even in an year. It's not going to be proven true once Bitcoin pumps
  to any specific price, and neither will it be proven false by a
  Bitcoin dump to some very low price.
   </p>
   <p>
    In fact, the Bitcoin thesis isn't something that will ever be "proven
  true" one day. Bitcoin can only continue to prove itself day after
  day, year after year, halving after halving, until eventually, it can
  prove undeniably that it has been around for a long, long time.
  Bitcoin will slowly transform into money over these many years,
  through the decisions of hundreds of millions of individual market
  participants - not by decree.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bitcoin is a lighthouse in a storm. It's a steadfast rock that sits
  quietly while the world around it is spinning in chaos. It's not a
  trade. It's a dynastic macro investing play that will take a long time
  to play out.
   </p>
   <h1>
    What will draw people to Bitcoin?
   </h1>
   <p>
    What will continue to draw people to Bitcoin is a real desire to
  escape the fiat system where everyone's money is slowly burning on
  fire and society itself is collapsing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bitcoin is digital gold. And it serves a real utility because people
  can use it to store value without risks of confiscation and
  debasement. It's much easier to take custody of and store than
  physical gold.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are obviously alternatives to storing value - fiat debt,
  businesses, real estate, art, etc. Yet none of these are truly money.
  They are all inferior to Bitcoin - they can be debased, they can only
  be held with third parties, they can be confiscated, etc.
   </p>
   <h1>
    What are the risks?
   </h1>
   <p>
    From my understanding, the only black swan events that could kill
  Bitcoin are:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     advancements in quantum computing that undermine Bitcoin
    cryptography
    </li>
    <li>
     some global crisis or conflict that destroys grid and Internet
    infrastructure
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Ultimately, Bitcoin is an experiment. It hasn't even been around for
  20 years, which is basically one human generation. I can't think of a
  word that is more appropriate to describe Bitcoin today than
  "experiment".
   </p>
   <p>
    However, even during it's short life, Bitcoin has had chance after
  chance to fail:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     in the beginning, when almost no people thought it had any value
    whatsoever
    </li>
    <li>
     after its first parabolic bull run
    </li>
    <li>
     blocksize wars and hard forks
    </li>
    <li>
     could have been hacked for nearly 15 years now
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    And yet Bitcoin is still here to this day, at a near all-time high
  price. That signifies something... and it is up to us to figure out
  what that something is, rather than project our own opinions onto
  reality.
   </p>
   <h1>
    Conclusion
   </h1>
   <p>
    It would be prudent for anyone who wishes to maintain the value of
  their savings or wealth to have a small allocation of Bitcoin, IMHO.
  Those with a greater appetite for risk and desire for larger potential
  upside can consider larger allocations. Contingent on due diligence,
  of course.
   </p>
   <p>
    Human life is short, and Bitcoin is very young - younger than even the
  average human today. The only thing Bitcoin can do right now is
  continue to prove itself over time by being a steadfast rock in a
  whirling storm. Patience is key.
