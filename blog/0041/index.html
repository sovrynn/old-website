    I've had some thoughts recently about what it would actually take for
  the Final Parabola to happen, and how exactly it would play out. The
  pieces are starting to come together, and I will cover my new thoughts
  in this blog post.
   </p>
   <h1>
    When will Bitcoin go to infinity against the dollar?
   </h1>
   <p>
    There's a very simple process through which this would happen. Bitcoin
  will go to infinity against the dollar when you can spend Bitcoin
  practically everywhere, or to purchase pretty much anything you might
  need, without selling it for dollars first. This will happen when
  merchants believe Bitcoin is a form of money, or at least a store of
  value, and accept Bitcoin directly as payment. This would create 0
  Bitcoin outflows and only inflows, quickly driving the price of
  Bitcoin to infinity against the dollar.
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon further thought, I realized that this doesn't require people
  literally everywhere to accept Bitcoin as payment to occur. During the
  process of hyperbitcoinization, I believe a significant part of the
  world population will be completely left behind and lose all their
  wealth in Bitcoin terms. A shift to accepting Bitcoin as payment only
  needs to happen in some critical-mass region (ex: red America) in the
  world for hyperbitcoinization to effectievly occur, significantly
  reducing Bitcoin outflows and making the Bitcoin price go to
  effectively infinity in dollar terms. Such a process would likely be
  accompanied by a significant migration of Bitcoin millionaires back to
  such a region so that they can spend their newly created wealth in
  peace and in large amounts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another important realization is that once such a shift happens,
  wealth will become completely redistributed. The reason is because
  that previously, the billions of dollars of Bitcoin market cap are
  actually fake unspendable wealth, because you can't actually cash out
  all that Bitcoin to dollars to spend it (not enough bid liquidity).
  However, once people accept Bitcoin directly as payment, that
  "inflated Bitcoin bubble" will suddenly crystallize as real, spendable
  wealth - every last penny of it. Bitcoiners will suddenly gain,
  collectively, trillions of dollars of spendable wealth effectively
  overnight, that can be spent without reducing the Bitcoin price at
  all. Realistically, the entire crystallization process might take an
  year. But by the end of it, wealth will be COMPLETELY redistributed,
  and you won't need any dollar liquidity to spend your Bitcoin.
   </p>
   <h1>
    What will drive such a shift to widely accept Bitcoin as payment?
   </h1>
   <p>
    I believe the mindset shift will happen rather quickly. All it
  requires is for the general population to BELIEVE a new idea. There
  are many things that could trigger such a mindset shift. But once a
  critical mass adopts this mindset shift in terms of public opinion,
  the rest of the masses will quickly follow.
   </p>
   <p>
    One event that could trigger such a mindset shift is Bitcoin reaching
  market-cap parity with physical gold. That could trigger a sudden
  narrative shift and realization that Bitcoin is the real deal.
  Suddenly, a wave of merchants adopting Bitcoin as payment takes hold,
  and the hyperbitcoinization process begins in earnest.
   </p>
   <h1>
    Conceptualizing what comes after significant merchant adoption
   </h1>
   <p>
    First, Bitcoin would begin to moon. As merchant adoption increases,
  outflows will decrease and the Bitcoin price will begin to rapidly
  climb.
   </p>
   <p>
    As Bitcoin moons, everyone in the world will be asking questions.
  Demand will increase as people start to FOMO, and people both inside
  and outside (but predominantly inside) Bitcoin economies will start to
  sell their fiat currency for Bitcoin.
   </p>
   <p>
    But it's not just fiat currency that will be sold for Bitcoin. People
  will take advantage of credit in an attempt to secure some physical
  Bitcoin while they can still use fiat currency to buy it. Credit cards
  will be maxed out and home equity will be tapped into with HELOCs.
  Brokerage accounts will be borrowed against. Personal loans will be
  taken out.
   </p>
   <p>
    All kinds of assets will also be outright sold for Bitcoin. 401ks will
  be tapped. Stocks will be sold. Bonds will be sold. Investment houses
  will be sold. Bitcoin will moon even higher.
   </p>
   <p>
    This process won't simply be limited to the US. This will begin to
  happen in economies all around the world - Europe. Asia. South
  America. Everyone around the world will be attempting to buy Bitcoin.
  Economies all around the world will suddenly switch to accepting
  Bitcoin as payment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once merchant adoption happens globally, the price of Bitcoin will
  SKYROCKET. Outflows will completely cease. Suddenly, overnight,
  Bitcoin will scream higher in price.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is when the real frenzy starts. Countries will begin to issue
  debt in an attempt to buy Bitcoin and accumulate it in their
  treasuries. Instead of announcing Treasury buybacks, the US government
  may announce Bitcoin purchases, funded through debt and Federal
  Reserve money printing. Third-world countries will simply print
  currency like mad to purchase Bitcoin.
   </p>
   <p>
    Up to this point, even as Bitcoin mooned, prices remained denominated
  in dollars and stayed stable. But as any and all people who own
  Bitcoin suddenly become millionaires, billionaires, and trillionaires,
  the wealth effect will become too powerful, and inflation will begin
  to kick in. Inflation will first kick in in earnest in early Bitcoin
  economies where practically every other common man and woman adopted
  Bitcoin early. As every such common man and woman becomes Bitcoin-rich
  (think every single person is a millionaire), prices will begin to
  climb higher in dollars. Real estate will go up. Rents will go up.
  Prices of services will go up. Wages will go up. Prices will go up.
  There could be anywhere from 100% to 1000% inflation, with inflation
  rates varying significantly across different kinds of goods and
  services. Specifically, consumer good price inflation will probably
  have the lowest inflation. However, prices will still be denominated
  in dollars, or fiat currency more generally. In non-Bitcoin economies,
  prices will still be stable. People everywhere will still accept fiat
  currency as payment.
   </p>
   <p>
    The frenzy to buy Bitcoin will continue to grow stronger every day. We
  will reach a point where every single man and woman, every company,
  every household, every government, every retirement fund, every
  organization of any kind on the planet will be selling their fiat
  currency to buy Bitcoin. At this point, literally no one will hold
  fiat currency. At the first chance they get, they will sell their fiat
  currency for Bitcoin. Fiat currency will only be used as a medium of
  exchange. The moment someone gets a hold of it, it will be spent or
  sold for Bitcoin. Bitcoin's price is essentially infinity in all fiat
  currencies all around the world, and Bitcoin is not only accepted but
  widely adopted or even preferentially requested as payment globally.
   </p>
   <p>
    At this point, inflation will not only be limited to the earliest
  Bitcoin economies. As Bitcoin literally goes to infinity in fiat
  terms, many economies that adopted Bitcoin will experience wealth
  effects and begin to see inflation. Fiat wealth will spill over
  everywhere due to the Bitcoin bubble effect. However, wealth will be
  redistributed very unevenly, with earlier Bitcoin adopters becoming
  significantly wealthier, but late adopters having to work for their
  Bitcoin. Additionally, early Bitcoin economies will be significantly
  wealthier than late Bitcoin economies.
   </p>
   <p>
    The earliest Bitcoin economies will be incredibly wealthy at this
  point. Inflation is picking up globally, but these economies see
  ridiculous levels of inflation; 1000% consumer price inflation, 2000%
  wage inflation, etc. There will be huge inflows of people moving to
  Bitcoin economies to earn the significantly higher wages. Fiat
  currency still circulates worldwide but is rarely used in these early
  Bitcoin economies.
   </p>
   <p>
    At some point, the earliest Bitcoin economies will begin to completely
  cease to use fiat currency. The first step will be for businesses to
  cease accepting fiat currency as payment. Subsequently, employees will
  demand payment in Bitcoin. Companies will stop holding fiat currency.
  Households will stop holding fiat currency. Rents will be paid in
  Bitcoin. Eventually, Bitcoin will be the only money in circulation in
  these Bitcoin economies. However, prices will still be widely
  denominated in dollars.
   </p>
   <p>
    As Bitcoin reaches multiple billions of dollars per coin, wealth
  effects will be extremely strong worldwide, and the Weimar Republic
  levels of fiat inflation that began in the earliest Bitcoin economies
  will start to kick in worldwide. Price stability will begin to become
  an issue as the high inflation that begins to kick off in poorer, late
  Bitcoin economies circles back to early Bitcoin economies. Prices will
  start to climb higher everyday.
   </p>
   <p>
    At some point, the earliest Bitcoin economies will begin to not only
  cease to use fiat currency as a medium of exchange, but also as a unit
  of account. People will begin to quote prices in Bitcoin for goods
  such as real estate or cars. Wages will start to become denominated in
  Bitcoin. Consumer goods will eventually be priced in Bitcoin. Such
  prices will fluctuate, but so long as they fluctuate less frequently
  and to a lesser degree than fiat prices, they will become widely
  adopted.
   </p>
   <p>
    As fiat inflation becomes untenable worldwide, eventually this process
  will occur in more economies around the world. Slowly but surely, more
  and more prices will become denominated in Bitcoin. Exports will
  become denominated in Bitcoin. Prices will continue to fluctuate, but
  less frequently than fiat prices.
   </p>
   <p>
    At this point, Bitcoin supply has become very widely distributed, but
  very unevenly. While wealthy people in early Bitcoin economies may
  often own 1 or 0.1 Bitcoins, the wealthy class in poor countries will
  only own 0.01 or 0.001 Bitcoins. Middle classes worldwide will likely
  denominate their wealth in sats, and in the most laggard Bitcoin
  economies, the majority of the population may only have perhaps 10,000
  sats of Bitcoin, with the poorest owning only 100 sats. While prices
  will be denominated in whole sats in early Bitcoin economies, late
  Bitcoin economies may eventually have to create smaller denominations
  than sats by splitting sats on L2s.
   </p>
   <p>
    One by one, economies worldwide will begin to discard fiat currencies
  entirely and do all commerce in Bitcoin. Prices worldwide will be
  denominated in Bitcoin, and begin to stabilize. Society and
  civilization will be completely transformed in ways I can't yet
  imagine. The world will be on a Bitcoin standard. The Final Parabola
  will be complete.
   </p>
   <h1>
    How long would it take for hyperbitcoinization to kick off?
   </h1>
   <p>
    It is unknown how long it would take for this process to kick off. As
  I said above, if Bitcoin reaching market-cap parity with gold is what
  sets off this process, it could start in earnest two cycles from
  today. At today's gold price, it would require Bitcoin to reach a
  price of 629,000 dollars per Bitcoin. That is a very high price but
  could be reached within two cycles.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's also possible that this process could kick off during the coming
  cycle, driven by nothing other than public opinion. El Salvador and
  Microstrategy will be huge success stories and near peak euphoria, we
  could see a wave of emulation, which could trigger a wave of merchant
  adoption.
   </p>
   <h1>
    Bitcoin will almost certainly be attacked
   </h1>
   <p>
    Currently, the US dollar is the only thing serving as legal tender in
  the USA. There will be a concerted effort by international
  capitalistic forces to suppress Bitcoin, and outlaw it from being used
  as legal tender.
   </p>
   <p>
    If that doesn't work, Bitcoin in brokerages and US crypto exchanges
  will likely be seized.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another scenario is that Internet infrastructure itself, which is NOT
  decentralized, will be attacked, and a new centralized CDBC-esque
  money introduced, to attempt to block off huge swaths of the Western
  economy from Bitcoin. I'm not sure how well this will work, but it
  will almost certainly create lots of enemies, since much as the fiasco
  going on in Israel today, the international capital bankers will be
  picking fights with the entire world in an attempt to maintain their
  grip on power.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bitcoin is essentially an attempt by the people to establish their own
  form of money, and thus, will not be allowed to roam free in the
  domain of the international capitalists if they can help it.
