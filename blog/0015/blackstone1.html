        At the recommendation of Anna Von Reitz, I have explored the writings
        of Robb Ryder, at whose recommendation, I have decided to read the
        books “Sir William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England in
        Four Books”. They seem to be fantastic foundational books for learning
        about law as it exists today. In this post, I will cover the first
        book, which is about the rights of persons.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are Vol 1 (Book I and II) and Vol 2 (Book III and IV)
        </li>
        <li>
          Vol 1 is about the rights of persons, and the rights of things
        </li>
        <li>
          Vol 2 is about private wrongs and public wrongs
        </li>

        University of Oxford in the year 1753.

        Section 1: Introduction (Pg 26)
      </h1>
      <p>
        I skipped this section. Seems to be the syllabus and meta-intro for
        the course. Also just a fun comment - English people of old structured
        ideas in written prose so differently than people do in written
        English today. Really tickles to read it.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Section 2: On the nature of laws in general (Pg 45)
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a beautiful 15 pages. Simply beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        This book defines two fundamental types of law:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, there is the law of nature aka natural law. Which comes from
          God. Who is ultimately wise, ultimately good, and ultimately
          powerful. The highest sovereign and superior being. These laws are
          innate and self-evident. An example of a natural law is to not
          commit murder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second, there is law which comes from revelations aka revealed law.
          Which is religion. And these laws can be found in the holy
          scriptures. Which is the Bible.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All human laws are based upon these two laws, and should not
        contradict them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If man lived alone, in nature, then only these two types of laws would
        apply to him. However, man lives not alone, but in society. This gives
        rise to the following two additional types of law:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Firstly, the law of nations. Since nations will not admit
          superiority to each other, the law of nations is based in
          natural/revealed law and compacts (seems to be old English for
          contract)
        </li>
        <li>
          Secondly, which is the main point of this section, is municipal law
          (“or civil law”). Municipal law governs districts, communities, or
          nations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This book defines municipal law as a “rule of civil conduct prescribed
        by the supreme power in a state, commanding what is right and
        prohibiting what is wrong”. Here are some very basic but profound
        qualities of municipal law:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          municipal law is permanent, uniform, and universal, as opposed to a
          sentence
        </li>
        <li>
          municipal law is a rule, as opposed to advice or counsel, because we
          are at liberty to follow advice or counsel, but we must obey the
          law, because it is the will of the maker. Counsel acts upon the
          willing, but law also to the unwilling
        </li>
        <li>
          municipal law is a rule, as opposed to a compact or agreement,
          because we choose to enter into compacts, but we must submit to laws
          without agreeing to it at all
        </li>
        <li>
          municipal law is a rule of civil conduct, as opposed to a rule of
          moral conduct. Natural and revealed law govern moral conduct, as
          well as faith, whereas civil law regards one as a citizen, and
          concerns duties which a citizen is obliged to fulfill for his fellow
          citizen in society
        </li>
        <li>
          municipal law is a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme
          power in a state. A requisite of law is sovereignty, as law cannot
          exist without it
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Fundamentally, municipal law is something a man gives up, or a duty
        that he takes up, by subjecting himself to the will of the sovereign,
        for the benefit of civil society and his fellow man.
      </p>
      <p>
        Government should be entrusted to one with the same qualities as the
        Supreme Being, which are wisdom, goodness, and power, as these are the
        natural foundations of sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
        All forms of government can be distilled to three forms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          democracy, which has the most goodness
        </li>
        <li>
          aristocracy, which has the most wisdom
        </li>
        <li>
          monarchy, which has the most power
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Every law consists of several parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a declaratory part, which declares what is right and what is wrong
        </li>
        <li>
          a directory part, which instructs to observe the rights, and refrain
          from the wrongs
        </li>
        <li>
          a remedial part, which points out a method to recover one’s rights
          or redress one’s wrongs
        </li>
        <li>
          a vindicatory part, which declares a punishment for doing wrongs or
          neglecting one’s duty
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Concerning the declaratory aspect of municipal law, municipal law does
        not strengthen or contradict natural law, which defines one’s rights,
        duties, and wrongs. However, where municipal law has an effect is in
        places of indifference. In such places, it defines what is right and
        wrong for the benefit of society and civil life. Additionally, it can
        define the particular circumstances and mode of natural law. For
        example, obedience to superiors is a natural law, but in areas of
        civil society, who one’s superiors are, and when and to what extent
        they should be obeyed can be defined by municipal law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concerning the vindicatory aspect of municipal law, municipal law can
        only compel or oblige certain behaviors, through incentives which can
        be reduced to punishments or rewards. Municipal law typically uses
        punishments instead of rewards, as they have a much lower cost. While
        wrongs governed both by natural law and municipal law have dual costs
        in the areas of conscience and punishment, wrongs governed only by
        municipal law solely have a cost of punishment.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Section 3: Of the laws of England (Pg 60)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Municipal laws can be defined by two categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          unwritten, or common law
        </li>
        <li>
          written, or statute (statutory) law
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Common law includes, in order of importance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          general customs
        </li>
        <li>
          the particular customs of certain parts of the kingdom
        </li>
        <li>
          peculiar laws, that are by custom observed only in certain courts
          and jurisdictions
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Blackstone takes much effort to make a specific distinction of
        categorizing as particular laws, civil or canon laws. Importantly,
        although these laws are nominally written, and declared by some
        authority in a specific jurisdiction, they are categorized as common
        (unwritten) law because they derive their power not from a sovereign,
        but by custom, by the consent of the governed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are specific definitions for civil and canon law in this context:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          By civil law is, “​​generally understood the civil or municipal law
          of the Roman empire, as comprised in the institute, the code, and
          the digest of the emperor Justinian, and the novel constitutions of
          himself and some of his successors”. I thought municipal and civil
          law were interchangeable but clearly there is a bit of
          context-dependent meaning here. In this context, I take civil law to
          mean the written civil law, as opposed to the general civil law
        </li>
        <li>
          Canon law concerns the Church.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In explaining why civil and canon laws are considered the third and
        most inferior category of common law, Blackstone talks about in which
        courts these laws can be applied, and how.
      </p>
      <p>
        Civil and canon laws can be used in the following courts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The courts of the archbishops and bishops, and their derivative
          officers, usually called in our law courts Christian
        </li>
        <li>
          The military courts
        </li>
        <li>
          The courts of admiralty
        </li>
        <li>
          The courts of the two universities
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now, Blackstone takes note of the following qualities of these courts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          “And, first, the courts of common law have the superintendency over
          these courts; to keep them within their jurisdictions, to determine
          wherein they exceed them, to restrain and prohibit such excess, and,
          in case of contumacy, to punish the officer who executes, and in
          some cases the judge who enforces, the sentence so declared to be
          illegal”
        </li>
        <li>
          The common law reserves for itself the interpretation of “all such
          acts of parliament as concern either the extent of these courts, or
          the matters depending before them”. Therefore, the people get to
          interpret all legislature concerning the scope/domain and subject
          matter of these courts.
        </li>
        <li>
          The power of the courts is derived from the King in England, and not
          from any foreign power, or intrinsic power of their own
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And from those observations, Blackstone concludes that civil and
        common laws are subordinate and inferior to unwritten law and custom.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second category of municipal law is the written laws, also known
        as statute law. These laws originate from the sovereign, whether that
        be a monarch, lords, parliament, etc. Statutes are either declaratory
        of the common law, or remedial of some defects therein. Here are when
        these two types of statute law may be applied:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When common law has fallen into disuse such that it is becoming
          disputable, then the sovereign may create some relevant statute law
          to clear that uncertainty
        </li>
        <li>
          When there is some defect in common law, arising from imperfections
          in human laws, or the mistake of some judge, or so on and so forth
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>

      <p>
        I skimmed over this section. I’m sure there are valuable tidbits of
        information in here, but I’d rather cover the actual meat of the book.
        If I can, I will return to this section to read it.

      <h1>
        Chapter 1: Of the absolute rights of individuals (Pg 93)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Another fantastic couple of pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, we need to define some things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Municipal laws can be divided into rights (duties, which are the
          rights of others, and rights) and wrongs
        </li>
        <li>
          Rights are divisible into the rights of persons, and the rights of
          things
        </li>
        <li>
          Wrongs are divisible into private wrongs, which concern individuals
          only, and are called civil injuries, and secondly, public wrongs,
          which affect the whole community, and are called crimes and
          misdemeanors
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Rights of persons can further be divided into absolute rights, and
        relative rights. Absolute rights (and duties) are those that would
        belong to them in nature, and which every man is entitled to enjoy,
        whether in or out of society. Similarly, absolute duties are those
        which man is bound to adhere to as an individual, and it is not
        expected that any municipal law should explain or enforce such rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        In principle, the scope of human (municipal) law when it comes to
        duties should only concern men so far as they are members of society,
        and the resulting social relationships, and thus municipal law should
        only govern relative and not absolute duties. For example, public
        sobriety is a relative duty, and thus enjoined by human law, but
        private sobriety may or may not be an absolute duty. However, when it
        comes to rights, human law should define and protect absolute rights
        as well as relative rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first and primary use of human laws should be to protect the
        absolute rights of individuals. Relative rights are secondary as these
        only become relevant once man enters into society. Relative rights
        will be more complicated and take up more space in the law, as there
        is a great deal of complexity in society, but this does not mean that
        relative rights are more important than absolute rights, and they are
        not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Man is born with natural liberty - the right to act as he sees fit.
        However, when man enters society, he naturally gives up some of his
        natural liberty, so that he may have security, and greater political,
        or civil, liberty. However, any wanton or causeless restriction of
        natural liberty of man is tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, there are some rights that are residual of natural liberty, that
        need not be sacrificed by the laws of society in exchange for civil
        liberty. These rights may be reduced to three primary rights, which
        are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the right to life and security
        </li>
        <li>
          the right to personal liberty
        </li>
        <li>
          the right to private property
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Concerning the right to life and security:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          More comprehensively, this consists of a person’s legal and
          uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, limbs, body, health, and
          reputation
        </li>
        <li>
          Life is a gift of God and inherent in every individual
        </li>
        <li>
          Limbs are necessary for self-protection
        </li>
        <li>
          A man who is under risk of losing either life or limb is basically
          given a pardon by law to do whatever is necessary to protect
          himself. Duress per minas does not include getting beaten, having
          one’s house burned, or loss of private property
        </li>
        <li>
          The law should not only protect this right, but also furnish man
          with whatever is necessary for life and security (aka welfare)
        </li>
        <li>
          Whenever a sovereign vests in some party the power to destroy life
          or limb without due process of law, that is the highest degree of
          tyranny
        </li>
        <li>
          The security of reputation consists of protection from detraction or
          slander. Without reputation, man cannot perfectly enjoy any other
          right
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Concerning the right to personal liberty:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This consists of the right of transportation and moving around to
          wherever one desires, without imprisonment or restraint
        </li>
        <li>
          A man should never be imprisoned or restrained without due process
          of law, and the cause must be made known to him
        </li>
        <li>
          If man did not have this right; if anyone could be imprisoned or
          restrained without due process of the law, then there would soon be
          an end to all other rights
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Concerning the right to private property:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Similar to previous two. No man should be divested of his private
          property without the judgement of his peers or the law of the land
        </li>
        <li>
          One caveat to this is if there is a situation where a man’s private
          property would benefit the public (ex: building a road). In this
          situation, the property should be used for the public good, and the
          sovereign can compel the man to give up his property. However, the
          man will be compensated fairly for it
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Man has the following methods to secure the actual enjoyment of the
        previous rights:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The constitution, powers, and privileges of the parliament
        </li>
        <li>
          The limitation of the king’s power, by bounds so certain and
          notorious, that it is impossible the King should mistake or legally
          exceed them without the consent of the people
        </li>
        <li>
          Applying to the courts for redress of injuries
        </li>
        <li>
          Petitioning the king, or either house of parliament
        </li>
        <li>
          Having arms for self-defence, in the situation where laws are
          insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression
        </li>
      </ul>

        Chapter 2: Of the parliament (Pg 107)
      </h1>
      <p>
        This seems to get into the weeds of England a bit. It may provide
        valuable historical context and useful information, but I would prefer
        to consume the most widely applicable information. So I will focus on
        the important parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first topic Blackstone covers is separation of powers - in all
        tyrannical governments, the right to both make and enforce laws are
        vested in the same man. But in England, these powers are separated
        into the parliament and King respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this chapter, Blackstone covers the following aspects of
        parliament:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the manner and time of its assembling
        </li>
        <li>
          its constituent parts
        </li>
        <li>
          the laws and customs relating to parliament considered as a whole
        </li>
        <li>
          the laws and customs relating to each house (there are two)
        </li>
        <li>
          the methods and proceedings of making statutes in each house
        </li>
        <li>
          the manner of the parliament’s adjournment, prorogation, and
          dissolution
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        The parts of parliament
      </h2>
      <p>
        The parts of the parliament are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the first house, consisting of the king, the lord spiritual
          (church), and the lords temporal
        </li>
        <li>
          the second house, which consists of the commons
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is key that the executive power (the king) is a branch of the
        legislative. Obviously the executive power cannot be the whole
        legislative because there would be no separation of powers and this
        would lead to a tyranny. However, if the executive power were to be
        completely disjoint from the legislative, the legislative would also
        become tyrannical, by gradually encroaching its boundaries and gaining
        executive powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extent of the king’s power in the legislative is to reject rather
        than create. This is the minimum sufficient power to create a
        separation of powers. The king has no power to do wrong in the
        legislative, only to prevent wrong. But even with this minimum power,
        the legislative cannot abridge the executive power of any of its
        current rights without the executive power’s own consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the checks and balances are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the nobility and commons are checks upon each other
        </li>
        <li>
          the king is a check upon each of these
        </li>
        <li>
          both the nobility and commons are checks not on the king (the king
          has “constitutional independence”), but on the king’s counselors
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The spiritual lords consist of archbishops and bishops, who are
        high-ranking members of the church.
      </p>
      <p>
        The temporal lords are nobility - dukes, marquisses, earls, vicounts,
        or barons. These temporal lords are considered sovereign to commons,
        and there is a wonderful quote from the book which justifies this:
        “The distinction of rank and honours is necessary in every
        well-governed state, in order to reward such as are eminent for their
        services to the public in a manner the most desirable to individuals,
        and yet without burden to the community; exciting thereby an ambitious
        yet laudable ardour, and generous emulation, in others: and emulation,
        or virtuous ambition, is a spring of action, which, however dangerous
        or invidious in a mere republic, or under a despotic sway, will
        certainly be attended with good effects under a free monarchy, where,
        without destroying its existence, its excesses may be continually
        restrained by that superior power, from which all honour is derived.
        Such a spirit, when nationally diffused, gives life and vigour to the
        community; it sets all the wheels of government in motion, * which,
        under a wise regulator, may be directed to any beneficial purpose; and
        thereby every individual may be made subservient to the public good,
        while he principally means to promote his own particular views”.
      </p>
      <p>
        The commons consist of all men of property in the kingdom who do not
        have a voice in the lords. Each of these men have a voice in
        parliament, either through their own voice, or through the
        representatives they have elected (this is where the House of
        Representatives originates from!). Blackstone justifies the
        representative system by saying that a proper democracy in a large
        nation is extremely hard to implement. Additionally, it can lead to
        voter fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
        Counties are represented by knights, and citizens and boroughs are
        represented by citizens and burgesses.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The laws and customs of parliament
      </h2>
      <p>
        The power and jurisdiction of parliament is sovereign - it “is so
        transcendent and absolute, that it cannot be confined, either for
        causes or persons, within any bounds”.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there still remains inherent in the people a supreme power to
        remove the legislative, since the people gave the legislative this
        power in the first place. However, there can be no legal steps for
        such a process, for if people remove the legislative, how can they
        follow a law created by the same legislative to do such a thing? There
        is a chicken and egg problem. So, as long as the parliament exists, it
        has absolute power.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are the following restrictions on sitting in parliament:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          must be 21 years of age
        </li>
        <li>
          must take the oath of allegiance before the lord steward or his
          deputy
        </li>
        <li>
          must in the presence of the house take the oath of allegiance,
          supremacy, and abjuration, and subscribe and repeat the declaration
          against transubstantiation, and invocation of saints, and the
          sacrifice of the mass
        </li>
        <li>
          no alien (regardless whether they are naturalized) can sit in
          parliament
        </li>
        <li>
          any house can prevent someone from sitting in parliament if there is
          complaint and proof of a crime committed by that person
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Members of parliament have the following privileges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The privileges of parliament are large and indefinite, and even
          greater, they are undefined. Courts cannot determine the privileges
          of parliament. The reason parliament has such privilege is to
          protect its members from being molested by their fellow subjects,
          but also by the king. If the privileges of parliament were to be set
          down, the king might be more able to encroach on that boundary and
          violate the freedom of parliament
        </li>
        <li>
          Freedom of speech both in and out of parliament
        </li>
        <li>
          privileges of persons, servants, lands, and goods
        </li>
        <li>
          privilege from illegal violence, but also from legal arrests, and
          seizures by process from the courts of law
        </li>
        <li>
          Privilege from being arrested and taken into custody, unless for
          some indictable offence, without a breach of the privilege of
          parliament
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        The customs of the house of commons
      </h2>
      <p>
        The house of commons has the sole power to create tax laws, although
        these still have to be approved by the other house. The reason is that
        theoretically, taxes are paid by the commons, and thus the commons
        should decide how to use them. There is one caveat that lords with
        tons of property are also taxed. However, since they are closer to the
        king, they are more susceptible to being influenced by the king, and
        so should not have power here. Lords still have the power to reject
        but not to resolve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The members of the house of commons are elected by democracy. And it’s
        very important to regulate who is allowed to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concerning the qualifications of the electors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The whole idea is to exclude people that are esteemed to have no
          will of their own. If such persons were able to vote, they would
          dispose of them under some undue influence. Blackstone provides a
          great argument as to why: “ If it were probable that every man would
          give his vote freely and without influence of any kind, then, upon
          the true theory and genuine principles of liberty, every member of
          the community, however poor, should have a vote in electing those
          delegates, to whose charge is committed the disposal of his
          property, his liberty, and his life. But, since that can hardly be
          expected in persons of indigent fortunes, or such as are under the
          immediate dominion of others, all popular states have been obliged
          to establish certain qualifications; whereby some, who are suspected
          to have no will of their own, are excluded from voting, in order to
          set other individuals, whose wills may be supposed independent, more
          thoroughly upon a level with each other”.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Concerning the qualifications of the electors for the knights of the
        shire, which are supposed to represent the landholders of the country:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          “every man shall have freehold to the value of forty shillings by
          the year within the county”
        </li>
        <li>
          “be clear of all charges and deductions” (which I assume to be debt)
        </li>
        <li>
          “The knights of shires are the representatives of the landholders,
          or landed interest of the kingdom: their electors must therefore
          have estates in lands or tenements, within the county represented:
          these estates must be freehold, that is, for term of life at least;
          because beneficial leases for long terms of years were not in use at
          the making of these statutes, and copyholders were then little
          better than villeins, absolutely dependent upon their lords: this
          freehold must be of forty shillings annual value; because that sum
          would then, with proper industry, furnish all the * necessaries of
          life, and render the freeholder, if he pleased, an independent man”
        </li>
        <li>
          basic requirements such as being 21 years of age, not being
          convicted of perjury
        </li>
        <li>
          cannot vote in right of freehold granted fraudulently
        </li>
        <li>
          “no person shall vote in respect of an annuity or rent-charge,
          unless registered with the clerk of the peace twelve calendar months
          before”
        </li>
        <li>
          one person per house or tenement
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Concerning the qualifications of the electors of citizens and
        burgesses, who are supposed to be the mercantile or trading interest
        of the country:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Apparently there is no fixed standard and it varies depending on the
          town in question
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Knights and citizens/burgesses get paid a salary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concerning the qualifications of those who are elected to sit in the
        house of commons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          cannot be aliens born, or minors
        </li>
        <li>
          cannot be a judge, clergy, charged with treason or felony, or a
          sheriff
        </li>
        <li>
          basically any government position is disallowed
        </li>
        <li>
          disallowed if you receive a government pension
        </li>
        <li>
          knights must have freehold worth 600 pounds, citizen/burgess worth
          300 pounds, EXCEPT the eldest sons of peers and knights
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        Elections
      </h2>
      <p>
        Any undue influences upon the electors is illegal and prohibited.
        Obviously this includes corruption - electees cannot give any money to
        their electors.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Concerning the making of laws
      </h2>
      <p>
        Bills originate in one of the houses. They must be signed by both of
        the houses before they are presented to the king, who must sign off on
        them. For either house, the decision of the majority binds the whole.
        Amendments to bills are often made. Either house, or the king, can
        reject the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a statute is placed into the records of the kingdom, it then has
        the force of law. At that point, every man in England has participated
        in the making of that law, by being present at parliament or by having
        one of their representatives present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a statute is the exercise of the highest authority acknowledged
        by the kingdom of England on Earth. It has power to bind every subject
        on the land. And it cannot be altered or removed without going through
        the same process, requiring the same strength to destroy as was
        required to create it.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Chapter 3: Of the King, and his title (Pg 132)
      </h1>
      <p>
        This chapter talks about the logistics of who gets the crown. The
        interesting parts were that the crown is hereditary rather than
        elective because elections lead to infighting (many examples in
        history) through corruption or the suspicion of it. Also, the crown
        being hereditary can be compared to land being hereditary (gets passed
        on to kids when someone dies). And, the two houses of parliament have
        the power to change the successor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the chapter is a bunch of history which I decided to skip.
        The chapter ends with a message about balance - elective succession
        will create infighting, while absolute hereditary succession will be
        “dreadful”. But the England government has checks and balances - a
        hereditary lineage with checks in the two houses.

      <h1>
        Chapter 4: Of the King’s royal family (Pg 149)
      </h1>
      <p>
        The most important member of the King’s royal family is the queen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The queen has powers to do things as an unmarried woman, which other
        married women cannot do, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          own land, and any related transaction such as renting
        </li>
        <li>
          taking a grant from her husband
        </li>
        <li>
          sue and be sued alone without her husband
        </li>
        <li>
          private property
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As usual, there is a very good justification for this, which is that
        the king should not have to spend cycles on his wife’s affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The queen also some marginal exemptions and privileges such as not
        having to pay tolls.
      </p>
      <p>
        However fundamentally, like any other subject, she is considered a
        subject of the king and not his equal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The queen also gets a cut of any money that goes toward the king! A
        minimum of 10%.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amusingly, although the queen is fundamentally a subject of the king,
        when it comes to the security of her life and person, she is put on
        the same footing as the king. So the woman benefits fully from the
        power of the king.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another really interesting tidbit - a husband of a reigning queen does
        not face the same degree of crime if he commits adultery compared to
        when the wife of a reigning king commits adultery. This is because if
        a wife commits adultery, it can potentially tarnish the hereditary
        bloodline, but if a man commits adultery, that doesn’t affect the
        bloodline. Again, a very good reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than the queen, the most important members of the royal family
        are those in immediate succession. Other than such person, there are
        not necessarily significant privileges.

        Chapter 6: Of the King’s duties (Pg 159)

        The King is subordinate to God and the law.

      <h1>
        Chapter 7: Of the King’s prerogative (Pg 161)
      </h1>
      <p>
        The whole idea is that the King has prerogatives such that he can do
        his job properly, and do not entrench any further on natural
        liberties, as is necessary to secure everyone’s civil liberties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The King has direct and incidental prerogatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Direct prerogatives can be divided into those concerning his
        character, those concerning his authority, and those considering his
        income. His income is considered in the next chapter.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Concerning the King’s character
      </h2>
      <p>
        It’s clear to any rational person that the King is simply a person no
        different than you and I, who is serving in the position of King. But
        Blackstone talks about how it’s important to basically create
        propaganda selling the King’s character as superior in order for the
        people to revere him so he can more easily do his job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, the King is sovereign. This part of the chapter is
        fascinating:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          he is superior to any other man
        </li>
        <li>
          no suit or action can be brought against the king, because no court
          can have jurisdiction over the King. If any party were able to have
          jurisdiction over the King, then the independence of the kingdom
          would be no more
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are the following remedies against private injuries and public
        oppressions done “by the King”:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For private injuries, if anyone has a just demand against the King,
          he must petition the King. But no one can oblige the King to do
          anything, only to persuade. Although the King would be foolish to
          refuse a fair and just agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          For public oppressions, the issue must be with his evil counselors
          and wicked ministers, as the King can do no wrong. Because if the
          law were to define a wrong that the King can do, it would also have
          to prescribe a corresponding punishment. Another way of looking at
          it is that if the law considers something to be corruptible, it will
          administer some higher power to check it, but how can a sovereign
          power (as the King is supposed to be) be a subordinate to some
          higher power? It is contradictory.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Secondly, the King is absolutely perfect. The King can do no wrong:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          in the conduct of public affairs
        </li>
        <li>
          the King can THINK no wrong. For example, if the King were to grant
          some franchise or privilege which is not rational, then it is not
          that the King thought wrong, but rather that the King was deceived.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The two houses are still allowed to provide criticism, although they
        usually direct this criticism toward the King’s advisors. In the
        august assemblies, they tend to directly criticize the King, but only
        in the most deferential and respectful way possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, the King is perpetual. The King never dies, although the
        people who are King may die.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Concerning the King’s authority
      </h2>
      <p>
        “He may reject what bills, may make what treaties, may coin what
        money, may create what peers, may pardon what offences, he pleases;
        unless where the constitution hath expressly, or by evident
        consequence, laid down some exception or boundary; declaring that thus
        far the prerogative shall go, and no further”.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a great many prerogatives in this chapter. I read through
        them but won’t bother writing all of them down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The King has full power concerning military/war.
      </p>
      <p>
        One interesting part was that the King is considered the greatest
        distributor (as opposed to creator) of justice. The King alone has the
        power to create courts, which aid him in the distributing of justice.
        And it is this relationship which explains that all courts get their
        power from the crown.
      </p>
      <p>
        The King is considered the prosecutor (the person who was injured) in
        any court case. This is because “all offences are either against the
        king’s peace, or his crown and dignity”. By the same token, the King
        has the prerogative of pardoning offences, because only he who was
        injured can pardon.
      </p>
      <p>
        An important point that Blackstone brings up here is that there is a
        separation of powers from the judicial with both the executive and
        legislative. This is because if the judicial is combined with the
        legislative, then the rights of subjects will be at the complete whims
        of whoever has both powers. And if the judicial is combined with the
        executive, then the legislative’s power is diminished (executive can
        interpret the law any which way). This is the reasoning for the three
        separation of powers in America!
      </p>
      <p>
        The King also has dominion over commerce and church.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Chapter 8: Of the King’s revenue (Pg 186)
      </h1>
      <p>
        The King gets revenue from a ton of places. I don’t remember all off
        the top of my head, but various taxes, from the church, forfeited
        goods and lands, mines, shipwrecks, rents, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, these are all the ordinary sources of revenue, but then
        Blackstone goes on to talk about extraordinary revenue, which is
        simply taxes. Blackstone argues that taxes are a preferable
        alternative to having the King have all his former lands, and take all
        the waifs, wrecks, estrays, deodands, etc. The idea is that subjects
        sacrifice some of their property to be able to enjoy the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grants, aids, subsidies, supplies; all synonymous with taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a fascinating piece in here which talks about the origin of
        land-tax. Specifically, knights had to serve in the King’s army for 40
        days per year. However, they first started sending people in place of
        them, but later, they chose to send money instead, which becomes a tax
        (And eventually the government extended this to landholders). So money
        in this example becomes a substitute for a service done. So in many
        ways, everyone who pays tax is actually working directly for the
        government. A 40% income tax rate is akin to having to work for the
        government, for free, for 40% of the working year. Incredible!
      </p>
      <p>
        Perpetual taxes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tax payable upon merchandise imported or exported. The justification
          for this is that the King gave the subject permission to depart the
          kingdom and take goods with him, and also that the King is
          responsible to maintain the ports and havens, and protect the
          merchants from pirates.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There is some amusing talk by Blackstone in this chapter about public
        debt and excessive taxation.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Chapter 9: Of subordinate magistrates (Pg 219)
      </h1>
      <p>
        There’s not that much transferable info from this chapter. It’s
        interesting to see that gradual progression by which new government
        positions are created (and never destroyed), gradually increasing the
        reach and scope of the government into all aspects of life, which also
        gradually creates a cost on the government which must be supported by
        the people. It is very parasitic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The subordinate magistrates (ie government officials) covered in this
        chapter consist of sheriffs, coroners, justices of the peace,
        constables, surveyors of highways, and overseers of the poor. They of
        course can elect their own subordinates and increase costs for the
        government. Principal-agent problem! Agents can hack the system.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Chapter 10: Of the people, whether aliens, denizens, or natives (Pg
        235)
      </h1>
      <p>
        So this chapter says that those born into the dominion of the King,
        are born into allegiance of the King also. Allegiance being that
        contract of binding the subject to the King, in return for the
        protection given by the King. This allegiance is implied by law and
        doesn’t need any oath to go into effect. Allegiance can be considered
        as a metaphorical debt because the King protected the subject when the
        subject was an infant and unable to protect themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is natural allegiance (upon birth) vs local allegiance (aliens
        traveling in the King’s lands).

        laity (everyone else).

        Chapter 12: Of the civil state (Pg 253)
      </h1>
      <p>
        The laity may be divided into three parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the civil
        </li>
        <li>
          the military
        </li>
        <li>
          the maritime
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The civil state can be divided into two parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the nobility (lords temporal in the parliament)
        </li>
        <li>
          the commonalty
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The nobility consists of dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, and
        barons. These titles originate from the King, who can create new
        titles. There isn’t much interesting here, except Blackstone makes a
        wise comment that dignity and duty should never be separated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peers have some privileges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          they are always tried by other peers. The justification is that you
          should always be tried by your equals
        </li>
        <li>
          cannot be arrested in civil cases
        </li>
        <li>
          swear in some cases upon their honor rather than taking an oath
        </li>
        <li>
          it is a greater offence to spread false rumors about them
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Commonalty also have names of dignity:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          knight
        </li>
        <li>
          baronets
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Commonalty also have names of worship:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          colonels, serjeants at law, and doctors as the three learned
          professions
        </li>
        <li>
          equires and gentlemen
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The rest of the commonalty are tradesmen, artificers, and labourers.

        Chapter 13: Of the military and maritime states (Pg 259)
      </h1>
      <p>
        The military state is the army.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blackstone notes that it is dangerous, in a land of liberty, to make a
        distinct profession of being a soldier. This is because theoretically
        soldiers should be citizens first, and soldiers second, only when
        needed, to protect the country. And if instead, being a soldier were
        to be made a profession, then it would be looked upon with jealousy.
        And this is how it worked in England in the past (no perpetual
        standing soldier) but not at the time the book was written.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, England was divided into “knight’s fees”, which were
        basically certain areas of land. And from each fee, a knight was
        supposed to serve the King for 40 days an year, ensuring that the King
        always had soldiers to go to war or defend the country with. As this
        eventually devolved into sending a double and eventually just money,
        this practice was eventually abolished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Martial law is completely arbitrary and based on the sovereign.
        Martial law should only be allowed during times of war, and not during
        times of peace. Because in times of peace, the King’s courts are open
        for justice. So if any officer in the military, in time of peace,
        kills any man under martial law, this is murder. And in the past, it
        was against the law for a King to keep a standing army in times of
        peace. But as of the book, England had a standing army, justified by
        saying that it was necessary for the protection of England.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s an interesting point - Blackstone notes that in order to
        prevent the executive power from being able to oppress the people, the
        armies should consist of the people, and have the same spirit with the
        people. So in a free state, it is key that the military power should
        not be too distinct from the people. It should be composed of natural
        subjects, be enlisted for a short period of time, and the soldiers
        should also live intermixed with the people rather than separately.

        Chapter 14: Of master and servant (Pg 268)

      <p>
        All the rights and duties of persons discussed thus far concern the
        public relations of magistrates and people, namely, the government.
        From this point forward, Blackstone discuss private relations, the
        three greatest of which are master and servant, husband and wife, and
        parent and child. Additionally, there is one more, which is guardian
        and ward.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some interesting tidbits in here for sure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is no justifiable reason in natural law for pure and proper
          slavery (complete sovereignty over someone)
        </li>
        <li>
          A master may justify an assault in defence of his servant, because
          he has an interest in not being deprived of his servant’s service,
          and a servant may justify an assault in defence of his master,
          because it is part of the servant’s duty, for which he receives his
          wages, to protect his master
        </li>
        <li>
          Whenever a servant commits a wrong, the master is generally also
          liable

        Chapter 15: Of husband and wife (Pg 274)

      <p>
        The law considers marriage no more than a civil contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        By marriage, husband and wife are one person in law. And so the entire
        legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or
        rather, is consolidated into that of the husband, under whose wing,
        protection, and power she does everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, the law supposes that the wife may perhaps have no will
        of her own, and act by her husband’s compulsion.

        This is a very interesting chapter. This book in general dives into
        the intricacies of all the areas of law, and while it may be dry to
        most, is fascinating to me because it shows the reasoning behind all
        the laws and these relationships. For example, they use the
        justification of “natural justice and retribution” to say that the
        parents who protected us during the weakness of our infancy are
        entitled to our protection in the infirmity of old age. Or, that the
        civil and canon laws do not allow a child to remain a bastard if the
        parents afterwards intermarry, but for English law, the child must be
        born after wedlock to be legitimate, for a several number of practical
        reasons.

        Chapter 18: Of corporations (Pg 293)

      <p>
        This is another beautiful chapter. A corporation is, figuratively
        speaking, an artificial body, whose parts may be replaced by living
        flesh and blood humans, but which lives on perpetually.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corporations can be aggregate or sole. Aggregate are the typical kinds
        of corporations we think of. Sole corporations are perpetual positions
        in society that are held by different people, such as the crown, or
        the archbishop, or the sheriff, etc. So even though the flesh and
        blood person in a sole corporation may die, the corporation lives on.

        Closing Thoughts
      </h1>
      <p>
        Overall I’m surprised by how rational it all is. I’ve also learned a
        lot about the system(s) in the States, as evidently the US
        Constitution and government is modeled after England’s legislature.
      </p>
      <p>
        After reading thus far, I am left with some confusion regarding the
        meanings of municipal law, civil law, and the law of England. I assume
        the following definitions for them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I take municipal law to be a general catch-all definition for
          man-made law
        </li>
        <li>
          I take civil law to concern common/private law, and not concern the
          sovereign, its subordinates, or the legislative. In section 3 of the
          intro, Blackstone does classify civil laws as the most inferior form
          of common law
        </li>
        <li>
          I take the “law of England” to mean statutory law (law created by
          the sovereign) as opposed to common law
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anyways, regarding the book… it’s simply pure wisdom, as far as I am
        concerned. Nuff said.
