  Gee, ATHs. I am incredibly excited for what will happen this coming
  year.
</p>
<p>
  I'm here today to talk about price predictions for Bitcoin. I've
  understood most of the other things to understand about Bitcoin but
  grokking the price, or rather, the purchasing power of Bitcoin after
  hyperbitcoinization (The Final Parabola) is rather difficult.
</p>
<h1>
  Caveats
</h1>
<p>
  Purchasing power is not a scalar, but a vector. The same money, over
  time, can have different purchasing power for different goods. We can
  see this clearly in the inflation rates of consumer goods over the
  last several decades, which has been much lower than the inflation
  rates in scarce goods such as shares of the US economy.
</p>
<p>
  The vector of purchasing power of money will have a different shape
  than today after hyperbitcoinization because Bitcoiners will choose,
  through the collective sum of their individual actions, how assets and
  goods get repriced. For a specific example, I believe gold will get
  devalued much more than promising tech companies such as Apple.
</p>
<p>
  With this caveat in mind, I will attempt to predict the future
  purchasing power of Bitcoin in today's dollars.
</p>
<p>
  One last thing is that as Bitcoin ushers in world peace and enhanced
  productivity, those factors along with technological advancements will
  increase the purchasing power of the same amount of Bitcoin over time.
  I'm not factoring that into my calculations here.
</p>
<h1>
  Typical heuristic
</h1>
<p>
  The typical heuristic is to consider the total wealth of the world,
  which is about $900T, and divide some percentage of that by the
  Bitcoin supply, which is 21mm. The logic is that Bitcoin will take
  some amount of market share from the total amount of world wealth.
</p>
<p>
  Optimistically, if we say Bitcoin captures ALL of the world's wealth,
  then Bitcoin becomes worth $40 million.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that may be wrong with this approach is that the market cap
  of Bitcoin may actually be greater than the market cap of all "stuff"
  in the world. For example, you could envision that if there's X stuff
  in the world, people collectively choose to keep 5X in Bitcoin
  savings.
</p>
<p>
  It's hard to be precise in that calculation though, because a lot of
  today's "wealth" is actually just financial accounting magic and
  monetary premiums on real estate and equities.
</p>
<p>
  Anyways, it's not that I don't follow the logic of this approach, but
  it's not bottoms-up enough for my liking. Let's take a look at some
  other approaches.
</p>
<h1>
  Method 1 - Rough estimate of fiat hyperinflation metric
</h1>
<p>
  There is about $120t of fiat currency worldwide.
</p>
<p>
  At what price will we begin to see Bitcoin wealth-effect-induced
  hyperinflation? Certainly not when the Bitcoin market cap is
  equivalent to the fiat currency market cap. Bitcoin being anyhere from
  10x to 100x the fiat supply seems reasonable.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Bitcoin 10x fiat -> $1 quadrillion mcap -> about $50mm
  </li>
  <li>
    Bitcoin 100x fiat -> $10 quadrillion mcap -> about $500mm
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  However I don't like this approach because we don't really know what %
  of fiat is circulating and we're not taking into account Bitcoin's
  circulating supply either. Also, as Bitcoin creates hyperinflation,
  existing assets will get repriced higher as well, reducing purchasing
  power.
</p>
<p>
  This method isn't robust in my view. However it's very bottoms-up and
  the key thing it shows is that Bitcoin won't reprice things until
  Bitcoiners start spending their Bitcoin and the world is FORCED to
  reprice things.
</p>
<h1>
  Method 2 - Circulating supply to GDP ratio
</h1>
<p>
  This is my preferred method of calculating the future Bitcoin
  purchasing power.
</p>
<p>
  World GDP is about $100t today. That GDP is facilitated by some amount
  of circulating fiat currency which is SPENT to contribute to that GDP
  number, which means the amount of circulating fiat currency must be
  less than $100t, because a lot of fiat currency is probably spent
  multiple times per year.
</p>
<p>
  If we very conservatively say that the velocity of money contributing
  to this GDP is 2 (spent 2 times per year) then the amount of fiat
  currency is $50 trillion.
</p>
<p>
  Now, in the future, predicting how much of the Bitcoin supply will be
  circulating and facilitating this same GDP, we can make a purchasing
  power prediction.
</p>
<p>
  If 5% of the Bitcoin supply is circulating, that means $50t = 5% of
  the Bitcoin supply. This means Bitcoin should be about $50 million
  dollars in today's money.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, the math changes depending on the velocity of money today
  baked into the $100t GDP statistic, as well as the future circulating
  supply of Bitcoin, as well as how the purchasing power vector will
  change through hyperbitcoinization.
</p>
<h1>
  Conclusion
</h1>
<p>
  All the methods actually end up giving similar price predictions for
  Bitcoin in today's purchasing power. As we all know, the nominal fiat
  price of Bitcoin is going to infinity, so nominal price predictions in
  the future are pretty meaningless.
</p>
<p>
  Some part of me still wants to seek a different heuristic, in the
  hopes that I end up with a reasonable argument for a much higher
  Bitcoin value at the end of all this. And I'll probably end up
  thinking about it randomly anwyays. But I think there's so many
  variables; and we all know it's going up anyways, so the best approach
  may be to simply hold tight and see where the dust settles when it's
  all over.
</p>
<p>
  One last thing - by the end of all this, there won't be any Bitcoin
  "floating around" that you can just pick up for some fiat. Fiat will
  be WORTHLESS. The only Bitcoin you can get in the future will be from
  mining or trading your scarce resources such as goods or labor for it.
  Every circulating Bitcoin will be being spent by a holder to purchase
  something. Every single person in the world will be attempting to
  hoard Bitcoin.
</p>
<p>
  It's time for me to move on to a new hobby rather than fantasizing
  about hyperbitcoinization all day. Till next time.
