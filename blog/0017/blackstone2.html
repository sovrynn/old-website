        DISCLAIMER: I didn’t proofread this blog post at all. There was so
        much material to get through and even my arbitrary synopsis has way
        too much material for me to want to proofread. There may be some
        grammatical mistakes, as well as awkward phrasings when I combine the
        writing style and old English language of Blackstone with my own
        writing style and modern English. This blog post is meant to be more
        of a notepad summary for my own reference, as well as a proof-of-work
        and reference to the general concept, rather than a rigorous summary.

      <h1>
        Ch 1: Of property in general (Pg 304)
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a fantastic foundational chapter and talks about the origins
        of property, and the right to it. Blackstone gives a great sequential
        and reasonable buildup to the property rights of today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Property is the right to have sole exclusive rights to use anything,
        while at the same time no one else can use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blackstone starts off by saying the right of humans to have property
        begins from the great Creator, as specified in the holy writ.
      </p>
      <p>
        But practically speaking, the concept of property begins by the law of
        nature and reason, where so long as someone is using something, he has
        a transient right to property. For example, no one owned the ground,
        but if someone was sitting in a spot of it, for shade, then he
        acquired a sort of ownership of it, and it would be unjust, and
        contrary to the law of nature, to drive him from it by force. But the
        instance that he ceased to use it, it would be fair for someone else
        to use it and assume transient ownership of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as mankind increased in number, craft, and ambition, it
        became necessary to allow for property of a more permanent nature, to
        avoid the chaos a situation where many people are always competing for
        property which has ceased to be transiently owned. For example, as
        humans grew more civilized, they invented various kinds of
        conveniences to help them live, such as shelter or clothes. But man
        wouldn’t labor to create these if, the moment he walked out of his
        tent, or took off his shirt, someone else could use and claim them.
        For shelter specifically, even lesser animals, such as birds or
        wolves, maintain a permanent property of their homes (ex: nests or
        caves), the trespassing of which is deemed a flagrant injustice, and
        would sacrifice their lives to protect them. And so man developed
        permanent property in his shelter. In the past they often used movable
        shelters (like tents) and so ownership of these came before ownership
        of land. And ownership of movables was also reasonable because they
        took bodily labour to create, and bodily labour is the most reasonable
        justification to property.
      </p>
      <p>
        The need for food also quickly led to a kind of property. As it was
        more consistent to yield food, people quickly came to be able to own
        herds of tamed animals. Additionally, wells were important to provide
        water to these herds. Those who dug the wells were justified to own
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before agriculture, the land was common, and when men and cattle had
        ate all the food in a certain area of land, it was deemed a natural
        right to go to another area of land and use it. Upon the same
        principle was founded the right to migration.
      </p>
      <p>
        As humans populated more of the land, it become difficult to find new
        spots to inhabit, without encroaching upon former occupants.
        Additionally, people would quickly consume all the food that was
        growing in a certain area of land. Thus it became necessary to
        practice agriculture, which necessitated a more permanent form of
        owning land. This was because there would be no reason for someone to
        farm on land if anyone else could just come and claim and seize it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Property, once acquired by the first taker, which taking amounts to a
        declaration that he intends to appropriate that thing for his own use,
        remains with the taker, until he does some act that shows intention to
        abandon it. So if someone casts some jewel into the sea, then he no
        longer owns it, as he has showed intention of no longer using it, and
        the first subsequent taker will own it. But if someone hides
        something, and it is found by another, then the original owner still
        has claim to it, as he showed the intention of using it again.
        Additionally, if someone drops or loses something by accident, then he
        has a claim to it even if someone else finds it first, since he lost
        it by accident, rather than intentionally casting it away from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, this method of someone losing his property, and another seizing
        the vacant possession, is well founded in natural law, but could not
        last for long. This is because when someone wants to get rid of
        something, there is usually someone else who would want that thing,
        and then they could trade for it. Thus was introduced the reciprocal
        transfer of property by sale, grant, or conveyance. Another way of
        looking at it is when I intend to give something to someone else, they
        are the first person to know of my desire to part with it, and thus
        step in and seize the vacant possession.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a man dies, he unarguably can no longer own property. However, it
        would be chaos if upon death, anyone could come and claim the
        property. Thus it is important to establish a way of deciding who gets
        property upon the death of the owner. He can leave a will, or the
        municipal law will decide a inheritor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The right of inheritance, or passing on property to children, is
        something that has been around forever. However, since the right to
        permanent property is a civil, rather than a natural right, the right
        of inheritance, which is based off of the right to permanent property,
        is also a civil, rather than a natural right. One way of thinking
        about it is that a man’s children are usually around at his deathbed,
        and thus are the first to know he has passed, and can also be the
        first to claim his now-unowned property.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some things which still remain common property, such as
        light, air, and water, and also untameable animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also things where an owner might exist, but often doesn’t,
        such as a shipwreck, forests, and wild animals to be hunted (game).
        The ownership of these is vested in the crown of England.

        Ch 2: Of real property; and first, of corporeal hereditaments (Pg 313)
      </h1>
      <p>
        The objects of property are things, as opposed to persons. Things can
        be divided into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          things real, which cannot be moved, such as land
        </li>
        <li>
          things personal, which can be moved, such as clothes or money
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Things real consist of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          land, which covers all things of a permanent nature
        </li>
        <li>
          tenement, technically a superset of land, but generally applied to
          houses and other buildings
        </li>
        <li>
          hereditament, the superset of the previous two, including not only
          land and tenements but anything that may be inherited, be it
          corporeal or incorporeal
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hereditaments are divided into two parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          corporeal, which affect the senses
        </li>
        <li>
          incorporeal, which are not the object of sensation, and exist only
          in contemplation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Corporeal hereditaments consist solely of substantial and permanent
        objects, which are land, and any structure upon it.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Ch 3: Of incorporeal hereditaments (Pg 315)
      </h1>
      <p>
        An incorporeal hereditament is a right issuing out of a thing
        corporate. Not the thing corporate (such as land) or the thing
        received from the hereditament (money from rent) but the abstraction
        itself (rent).
      </p>
      <p>
        Incorporeal hereditament are of ten sorts: advowsons, tithes, commons,
        ways, offices, dignities, franchises, corodies or pensions, annuities,
        and rents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advowson: The right to recommend someone for some church position
      </p>
      <p>
        Tithe: A tax upon lands of the profit, the stock, and the personal
        industry of its inhabitants
      </p>
      <p>
        Common: A privilege which a man has in someone else’s land
      </p>
      <p>
        Way: A right of going over another man’s ground
      </p>
      <p>
        Office: A job
      </p>
      <p>
        Franchise: A royal privilege, or a branch of the King’s prerogative,
        subsisting in the hand of a subject
      </p>
      <p>
        Corody: A right of sustenance, or to receive provision for one’s
        maintenance. In lieu of which, money may be provided instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Annuity: Same as corody, except these arise from temporal, whereas the
        previous from spiritual, persons
      </p>
      <h1>
        Ch 4: Of the feodal system (Pg 329)
      </h1>
      <p>
        The feodal system really helps to understand what a possible
        justification for a real estate tax might be.
      </p>
      <p>
        When an army conquered a new land, officers were able to recursively
        distribute the lands among their subordinates, in exchange for an oath
        of fealty. As review, an oath of fealty consists of, or includes, an
        obligation of the tenant to protect the lands of the lord. These
        allotments of lands were called feuds, fiefs, or fees. If the oath of
        fealty were broken, then the land would be returned to the grantor.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the top of this distribution tree sits the crown. And so this
        entire recursive system of oaths of fealty is called the feodal
        system. It creates a military power which is ready to defend the
        entire land.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blackstone says that England almost certainly did not originate from a
        feodal system, yet in the history of England, England was persuaded or
        compelled to switch to a feodal system for military security purposes,
        or by cunning businessmen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, instead of the actual service of fealty, a tenant can
        simply send some money instead, which is how we could justify some
        kind of real estate tax.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Ch 5: Of the ancient English tenures (Pg 338)
      </h1>
      <p>
        If the thing holden is a tenement, then the person holding it is a
        tenant, and the manner in which it is held is a tenure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tenures are products of, or remnants of, feodal policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two categorizations of services which a tenant must do for
        his lord:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Free or base services. Free services are those which are not
          unreasonable for a soldier or freeman to do, while base services are
          only fit of those of a servile rank, such as plowing land
        </li>
        <li>
          Certain or uncertain services. Certain service have a regular time
          upon which they must be done, whereas uncertain services do not
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now, based on these kinds of services, there are four kinds of lay
        tenures:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Tenements can be divided into frank-tenement and villenage
        </li>
        <li>
          Of frank-tenements, some are held freely in consideration of homage
          and knight-service, while others are held with the service of fealty
          only
        </li>
        <li>
          Of villenages, some are pure, and some are privileged. Pure
          villenages are where the tenant must do whatever his lord commands,
          including any uncertain service. The other is called villein-socage,
          where the tenant does villein services, but only certain and
          determined ones
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So, the four types of tenures:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Services free and uncertain (chivalry)
        </li>
        <li>
          Services free and certain
        </li>
        <li>
          Services base and uncertain
        </li>
        <li>
          Services base and certain
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        Type 1: knight-service, or chivalry
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is the most honorable one. The service is free and uncertain (ex:
        military service with homage). 40 days of military service for a
        knight’s fee, which was the necessary amount of land to have a
        knight-service tenure.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also had these seven fruits and consequences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Aids, which were normally discretionary benevolences granted by the
          tenant to the lord. But these came in time to be obligations. They
          are to ransom the lord, ensure the lord’s eldest son becomes a
          knight, and ensure the lord’s eldest daughter gets married. But
          eventually there were more aids added, such as aids to pay the
          lord’s debts, or aids for the lord to pay aids to his lord
          (skip-lord). But eventually the aids came to be fixed at 5%.
        </li>
        <li>
          Relief is a one-time payment when the tenant first entered into
          tenure
        </li>
        <li>
          Primer seisin is basically like a relief of land that is given to a
          tenant directly from the King, when the tenement is passed from a
          tenant to a tenant’s heir. The idea is that once the tenant dies,
          the King gets the tenement, but then grants it back to the heir, so
          deserves something for it. The King will take half a year, or a full
          year, of profit from the land
        </li>
        <li>
          Primer seisin is only applicable if the heir is 21 if male, or 16 if
          female (female can marry and let her older husband perform the
          tenure service). If the heir is too young, the King gets wardship of
          the tenement, as well as the heir. The whole idea is that the King
          is supposed to get a service in exchange for the tenure, and so will
          bring up the heir, till they can provide that service. And while the
          King isn’t getting a service, he will get to keep the land.
        </li>
        <li>
          In wardship, lord also gets to marry off the heir, especially a
          girl, and pocket any proceeds from the marriage. The justification
          is that the lord had to provide their consent for the heir to be
          married
        </li>
        <li>
          Tenants also had to pay fines for every alienation, which is a sale
          of property. The justification is that as part of the original
          tenure, the lord and tenant had an agreement of tenements for
          service. And so the tenant needed the lord’s approval to do an
          alienation. In England, this fine only happened for tenementns
          directly from the King
        </li>
        <li>
          Escheat is the return of the tenement to the lord if the tenant dies
          without a heir, or commits some treason or felony
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are all the conditions of this kind of tenure. But what ended up
        happening is that knights eventually started sending doubles and then
        making a pecuniary satisfaction instead of serving the 40 days of
        military service because it was so troublesome. But as this happened,
        all the benefits of the feodal service decayed (having a military
        power that could protect lands) and only the hardships remained. And
        all these extensive conditions I listed above were taking a toll on
        people and basically taking their entire existence away (like taxes do
        in America today). Eventually there was a statute introduced that
        abolished all these military tenures.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also similar tenures where the service is not to serve in
        the military for 40 days but other various acts such as holding the
        King’s banner.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Ch 6: Of the modern English tenures (Pg 349)
      </h1>
      <p>
        The modern English tenures consist almost solely of services free and
        certain (free-socage). Basically, no base tasks, and certain
        conditions (as opposed to uncertain military conditions). Free-socage
        is considered a more noble tenure than the following one I describe.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is one more category of tenure which is villenage, which
        includes base services. People in this kind of tenure used to be
        essentially slaves, but over time, through the customs, these have
        been converted to copyholds, where the tenants still have to perform
        various services (or pay some rents) but they can’t necessarily be
        totally owned or ousted at the lord’s will.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also spiritual tenure, typically given to church-related
        organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall this is an interesting chapter. I’m not going to recite all
        the details of it but essentially it dives into the different types of
        tenures, what rights or services tenants had or had to perform, and
        through the categorization of all these different types of tenures,
        creates a bird-eye view as to how tenures work (rather than simply
        accepting tenures for how they are and reacting to the world).

        Ch 7: Of freehold estates of inheritance (Pg 364)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Estates have three dimensions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the quantity of interest the tenant has in the tenement
        </li>
        <li>
          the time at which that quantity of interest is to be enjoyed
        </li>
        <li>
          the number and connections of tenants
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Estates can be divided into freeholds, and less-than-freeholds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Estates of freehold can be divided into estates of inheritance, or
        estates not of inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Estates of inheritance can be further divided into inheritances
        absolute or fee-simple, and inheritances limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Estates-tail, or fee-tail is when there are some conditions attached
        to what would normally be a fee-simple estate.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Estates in possession are the normal kinds of estates we talked

          sequentially, after some condition
        </li>
        <li>
          Estates in reversion are when someone has granted out lands to some
          lessee, but the estate will vest back in the grantor on some
          condition. This comes from the feodal system apparently

        Ch 12: Of estates in severalty, joint-tenancy, coparcenary, and common
        (Pg 408)
      </h1>
      <p>
        An estate in severalty is held by a single person. This is the default
        estate, when speaking about estates. The interesting ones are the
        other ones, which always have multiple tenants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joint-tenancy is where lands or tenements are granted to two or more
        persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coparcenary is where lands of inheritance descend from the ancestor to
        two or more persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tenancy in common is where lands are held by several and different
        titles, but with unity of possession.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Ch 13: Of the title to things real, in general (Pg 417)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Another interesting high-level chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several stages of requisite to form a complete title to
        lands and tenements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The lowest degree of title consists in the mere naked possession, or
          actual occupation, of the estate, without any apparent right, to
          continue and hold such possession
        </li>
        <li>
          The next step is the right of possession, which may reside in one
          man, while the actual possession resides in another. The man with
          the right of possession may exercise his right at any time. There
          are also two kinds of this possession - apparent right of
          possession, and actual right of possession. An apparent right of
          possession may be overcome by proving a better right of possession,
          but an actual right of possession will stand the test against any
          opponent.
        </li>
        <li>
          The next step is the right of property, which is independent of
          possession and even the right of possession. The lines start to
          become a little fuzzy here, but basically, a person in this
          situation may technically have the right to something, but through
          his own negligence, the act of his ancestor, or the decision of some
          court, someone else has the right to possession.
        </li>
        <li>
          The last step is the complete title to lands and hereditaments. In
          this step is joined the right of possession with the right of
          property.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>
        Ch 14: Of title by descent (Pg 420)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Whenever, by one method, a man gains an estate, another loses it. For
        example, when an heir acquires an estate in the form of inheritance,
        someone loses the inheritance by death.
      </p>
      <p>
        The methods of acquiring an estate can be reduced to two categories:
        by descent, and by purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        This chapter doesn’t talk about niche customs or statutory laws of
        descent, but only of common law.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is lineal (direct descendant of each other) and collateral (same
        ancestor, but not direct descendants of each other) consanguinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some rules of inheritance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Inheritances shall lineally descend but not ascend
        </li>
        <li>
          The male issue shall be admitted before female
        </li>
        <li>
          Where there are two or more males, the eldest only shall inherit,
          but females equally
        </li>
        <li>
          The direct (one-degree) lineal descendants shall represent their
          deceased ancestor
        </li>
        <li>
          On failure of lineal descendants, the inheritance shall descend to
          collateral relations of the first purchaser
        </li>
        <li>
          The collateral heir of the person last seised must be his next
          collateral kinsman of the whole blood
        </li>
        <li>
          The seventh and last rule or canon is, that in collateral
          inheritances the male stocks shall be preferred to the female
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>
        Ch 15: Of title by purchase and 1. By escheat (Pg 444)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Purchase means any form of acquisition of lands and tenements
        excluding descent. Colloquially it refers to a sale, but from a
        rigorous standpoint, it includes other things such as gifting an
        estate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Escheat is when the chain of inheritance is broken and the land
        returns to the original lord or the King.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lot of knitty gritty in this chapter. I won’t rewrite it here.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Ch 16: 2. Of title by occupancy (Pg 454)
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is when you can go on unowned land and claim it as yours by
        occupying/using it. Only one case where this is allowed in English
        law.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Ch 17: 3. Of title by prescription (Pg 457)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Title by prescription is when a man can only use precedent to justify
        his ownership of it - “clearly we must own it, because we’ve been
        using it like we owned it for the last 3 generations!”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prescriptions can only apply to incorporeal hereditaments (rents,
        advowsons, etc). Because any physical hereditament would have a more
        solid kind of title (inheritance, etc).
      </p>
      <h1>
        Ch 18: 4. Of title by forfeiture (Pg 460)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Forfeiture is a punishment, upon he who committed a crime, where he
        loses his assets (this word has a more specific meaning explained in a
        prior chapter, but I will use it with today’s colloquial definition)
        and they go to the party injured or the public as recompense for his
        wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lands, tenements, and hereditaments may be forfeited by the following
        means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          by crimes and misdemeanors
        </li>
        <li>
          by alienation contrary to law
        </li>
        <li>
          by non-presentation to a benefice, when the forfeiture is
          denominated a lapse
        </li>
        <li>
          by simony
        </li>
        <li>
          by non-performance of condition
        </li>
        <li>
          by waste
        </li>
        <li>
          by breach of copyhold customs
        </li>
        <li>
          by bankruptcy

        Ch 19: 5. Of title by alienation (Pg 472)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Alienation refers to any method wherein estates are voluntarily
        resigned by one man and accepted by another. Alienation includes sale,
        gift, marriage, and other methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are 4 ways to alien something:
      </p>

        <li>
          deed

        <li>

      <h1>
        Ch 20: Of alienation by deed (Pg 477)
      </h1>
      <p>
        There is a lot of good stuff in here. Let’s go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wonderful quote - a deed, “is the most solemn and authentic act that a
        man can possibly perform, with relation to the disposal of his
        property; and therefore a man shall always be estopped by his own
        deed, or not permitted to aver or prove any thing in contradiction to
        what he has once so solemnly and deliberately avowed”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deeds at first glance are not general-purpose contracts. Deeds are
        legal ways to alienate property, although this encompasses more than
        just actual sales. However, after going through the various kinds of
        deeds, perhaps deeds actually encompass a large majority of most of
        the different kinds of contracts that may be created.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several requisites to a deed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There must be people able to contract and be contracted with, and
          also a thing to be contracted for
        </li>
        <li>
          The deed must be founded upon good and sufficient consideration.
          Such consideration can either be good or valuable. A good
          consideration is one of blood, or more generally, natural love and
          affection, and is based on motives of generosity, prudence, and
          natural duty. A valuable consideration is such as money or marriage,
          where the law esteems an equivalent given for the grant, and is thus
          founded upon justice.
        </li>
        <li>
          must be written
        </li>
        <li>
          The matter written must be legally or orderly set forth.
        </li>
        <li>
          The dead must be read
        </li>
        <li>
          The party must seal and sign the deed
        </li>
        <li>
          must be delivered by the party himself or his certain attorney
        </li>
        <li>
          the attestation, or execution of it in the presence of witnesses
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here are the written parts of a deed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The premises, which contain the parties and the reasons for the
          present transaction
        </li>
        <li>
          The habendum, which is a clarification on the estate or interest
          granted in the deed
        </li>
        <li>
          The tenendum, which is mostly deprecated
        </li>
        <li>
          The terms of stipulation, where the grantor can create or reserve
          something for himself out of what he has just granted, such as a
          rent or service
        </li>
        <li>
          A condition, which is a clause of contingency, which is a
          requirement for the grant to be valid
        </li>
        <li>
          The clause of warranty, which is an obligation on the grantor to
          honor the tenant to be secure in the estate. The obligation of
          warranty often extends to the heirs of the grantor
        </li>
        <li>
          Covenants, which are clauses of agreement contained in a deed, where
          either party may stipulate for the truth of certain facts, or may
          bind himself to perform or give something to the other
        </li>
        <li>
          The conclusion, which mentions the execution and date of deed
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Deeds which are generally used to convey real estates, are called
        conveyances. Conveyances are either conveyances at common law, or
        receive their force and efficacy by virtue of the statute of uses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conveyances by the common law are either original or primary, which
        create a new estate, or derivative or secondary, which modify a
        pre-existing estate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Original conveyances include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          feoffment
        </li>
        <li>
          gift
        </li>
        <li>
          grant
        </li>
        <li>
          lease
        </li>
        <li>
          exchange
        </li>
        <li>
          partition
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Derivative conveyances include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          release
        </li>
        <li>
          confirmation
        </li>
        <li>
          surrender
        </li>
        <li>
          assignment
        </li>
        <li>
          defeazance
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Then there are conveyances which have their force and operation by
        virtue of the statute of uses. And again something excitingly relevant
        - apparently uses and trusts are in their original of a nature very
        similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The origin of the name of uses and trusts is very literal - you
        entrust some land to A for the use of B.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the conveyances stemming from uses/trusts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          covenant to stand seised to uses
        </li>
        <li>
          bargain and sale of lands
        </li>
        <li>
          lease and release
        </li>
        <li>
          deeds to lead or declare the uses of other more direct conveyances,
          as feoffments, fines, and recoveries
        </li>
        <li>
          deeds of revocation of uses
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Finally there are deeds which are used not to convey, but to charge or
        encumber, lands, and to discharge them again:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          obligations or bonds
        </li>
        <li>
          recognizances
        </li>
        <li>
          defeazances
        </li>
      </ul>

        Chattels are distributed into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          chattels real, which concern land, although they aren’t actually
          estates. They are simply interests issuing out of, or annexed to,
          real lands. Examples of chattels real and terms for years of land
          and wardships in chivalry. Fundamentally, it seems chattels real
          have limitations on their duration
        </li>
        <li>
          chattels personal, which are things movable, and can be carried
          about with the owner from one part of the world to another. Examples
          are clothes, jewelry, and cattle
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>
        Ch 25: Of property in things personal (Pg 532)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Property in chattels is either in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          possession, which is where a man not only has the right to enjoy,
          but actually enjoys, the usage of the property
        </li>
        <li>
          action, where man has only the bare right to enjoy, without the
          enjoyment
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        Property in possession
      </h2>
      <p>
        Property in possession is of two kinds - absolute and qualified:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          absolute property is pretty self-explanatory, where a man has the
          sole and exclusive right of something, so that they cannot be
          transferred from him, or cease to be his, without his own act or
          default
        </li>
        <li>
          qualified property is not permanent, and may sometimes subsist but
          at other times not subsist
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Fire, light, air, and water are qualified property. As long as I am
        using them, it is wrong for someone else to deprive me of my enjoyment
        of these by soiling my windows, corrupting my air, or fouling my
        water.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mail delivery man also has qualified property of the mail he is
        delivering. For he has the possession but not the right to own.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Property in action
      </h2>
      <p>
        An example would be where a debtor fails to make their payments, and
        now the debtee has a “chose” in action for some recompense.
      </p>
      <p>
        All property in action depends entirely upon contracts, either express
        or implied.

        or less personal property. This chapter covers the first one -
        occupancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This chapter goes over many interesting edge cases, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the right to seize goods belonging to an alien enemy
        </li>
        <li>
          movables on the surface of the Earth or in the sea are claimable,
          with the exception of objects such as waifs or wrecks, which belong
          to the King
        </li>
        <li>
          the elements, such as light, air, and water, can only be claimed by
          occupancy.
        </li>
        <li>
          untamed animals can be claimed, except game, and royal fish
        </li>
        <li>
          crops

        Ch 27: Of title by prerogative and forfeiture (Pg 543)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Prerogative refers to the King’s prerogative. The King has prerogative
        to own certain objects, and can grant them out, and in the case of
        prescription, the existence of an ancient grant can be assumed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The King, among others, has the following titles by prerogative:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          cannot be a joint-owner
        </li>
        <li>
          copyright to certain literary works such as the Bible
        </li>
        <li>
          game. The King can grant this out to people
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Forfeiture is when you lose (and some other party gains) property as a
        result of crime or misdeameanor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following cases are where one loses everything they own through
        forfeiture:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          high treason
        </li>
        <li>

        <li>

        Ch 28: Of title by custom (Pg 551)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Blackstone says there are too many various customs to cover. So, this
        chapter just covers three kinds of customary interests - heriots,
        mortuaries, and heir-looms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heriots includes heriot-service and heriot-custom. Heriot-custom is a
        customary tribute of goods and chattels, payable to the lord of the
        fee on the decease of the owner of the land. Supposedly they were
        originally voluntary but became a custom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mortuaries are like ecclesiastical heriots, being a customary gift
        claimed by and due to the minister in very many parishes, on the death
        of his parishioners. Again these were supposedly voluntary but became
        a custom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heirlooms are goods and chattel which go by custom to the heir instead
        of the executor of the will. Apparently all chattel other than
        heirlooms should go to the executor instead of the heir. Which I don’t
        really understand.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Ch 29: Of title by succession, marriage, and judgement (Pg 556)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Succession is only applicable to corporations aggregate, where people
        of real flesh and blood succeed the previous people in the
        corporation, and thus take up the property of the corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Succession also applies to sole corporations who is representative of
        a number of persons, such as the head of a hospital. The exception to
        this rule is the King, and special cases of customs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In marriage, property of the wife is vested in the husband. The whole
        reasoning behind this is, as previously discussed, that a woman’s
        legal entity merges into the husband’s upon marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judgement is when property is vested in someone (and taken away from
        someone else) by decision of court. The book makes an interesting
        discussion between cases where a person already has a right to
        property, and only acquires a possession to property, through the
        court. In this case, the court simply enforces property rights. But in
        other cases, the court can actually be a means to acquire not just
        possession but also a right to property at the same time. An example
        of this is when a court decides how much someone at fault should
        compensate whoever is at loss.
      </p>
      <h1>
        Ch 30: Of title by gift, grant, and contract (Pg 562)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Gifts or grants vest property in possession, whereas contracts vest
        property in action (right without possession).
      </p>
      <p>
        Gifts are gratuitous (receive nothing in return) whereas grants are
        upon some consideration (receive something in return). As usual, gifts
        or grants real concern land, whereas gifts or grants personal concern
        chattel (personal goods).
      </p>
      <p>
        A contract is defined as, “an agreement, upon sufficient
        consideration, to do or not to do a particular thing”. Contracts have
        three parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the agreement
        </li>
        <li>
          the consideration
        </li>
        <li>
          the thing to be done or omitted
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Contracts can be express (everything stated literally) or implied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contracts may be executed (convey a chose in possession) or executory
        (convey a chose in action).
      </p>
      <p>
        Considerations are divided into four kinds:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          “Do, ut des” - when I give money or goods, on a contract that I
          shall be repaid money or goods
        </li>
        <li>
          When I agree to do (or not do) something for someone, if they will
          do (or not do) something for me. Marriage falls into this category
        </li>
        <li>
          When a man agrees to perform something for a price. Such as work
        </li>
        <li>
          When a man agrees to pay someone for work. The inversion of the
          prior contract
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A contract to do something on one side, without any consideration on
        the other, is void in law. Which makes sense. You also can’t contract
        someone to perform something in honor or conscience. However,
        reciprocity, or prior moral obligation, is enough consideration for a
        valid contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, the thing to be done in contracts is often of four
        categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          sale or exchange
        </li>
        <li>
          bailment (a delivery of goods in trust)
        </li>
        <li>
          hiring and borrowing
        </li>
        <li>
          debt
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bailment is interesting. It includes situations such as a delivery man
        possessing mail, or an innkeeper possessing a traveler’s horse. In
        bailment, you give the possession of property to someone else, leaving
        the chose in action to the grantor. I love how this book deconstructs
        these concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hiring actually means renting in this chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding common practices related to interest rates:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          bottomry (ship/good collateralized loans)
        </li>
        <li>
          insurance, which protects against ruin
        </li>
        <li>
          annuity for life is like a loan but without a fixed repayment
          schedule, and is paid over the duration of one’s life
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Debts can be divided into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          debts of record (where money is due by the decision of court)
        </li>
        <li>
          debts by specialty, or special contract
        </li>
        <li>
          debts by contract
        </li>
      </ul>

        Ch 31: Of title by bankruptcy (Pg 580)
      </h1>
      <p>
        The English law only allows traders (merchants) to be considered
        bankrupt (and thus benefit from the laws of bankruptcy), because they
        are presumed to take on more risk than normal people.
      </p>
      <p>
        A man who avoids creditors is bankrupt. What a good definition! This
        prevents a man from wasting his resources, and then claiming the
        benefit of the statutes, when he has nothing left to distribute. He
        can be declared bankrupt right from the moment he begins avoiding
        creditors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wow. If someone declared bankrupt does not surrender themselves to the
        government 42 days after being declared bankrupt, they “suffer death”.
        Which I assume is the death penalty.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if the bankrupt person complies, “the bankrupt is entitled to a
        decent and reasonable allowance out of his effects, for his future
        support and maintenance, and to put him in a way of honest industry”.
        Which is nice. And they are also discharged of all debts.

        Ch 32: Of title by testament, and administration (Pg 591)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Testament, and administration - by death!
      </p>
      <p>
        Three kinds of people are not allowed to have wills:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          those with lack of sufficient discretion such as children
        </li>
        <li>
          those with lack of sufficient liberty and free will
        </li>
        <li>
          criminals
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Marriage revokes formerly made wills.
      </p>
      <p>
        An executor is someone chosen by the testator to execute his will.
      </p>
      <p>
        Administrator seems to be someone appointed to do such a role, which
        may happen if someone creates a will without specifying an executor,
        or doesn’t create a will at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interest vested in the executor may by continued and kept alive by
        the will of that same executor. However, this doesn’t hold true for
        administrators. This is because there is a special trust between the
        deceased and executor, but this doesn’t hold true for administrators
        (who were not chosen by the deceased).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the powers and duties of a rightful executor or
        administrator:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          He must bury the deceased
        </li>
        <li>
          He must prove the will of the deceased
        </li>
        <li>
          He must make an inventory of all the goods and chattels
        </li>
        <li>
          He is to collect all the goods and chattels thus inventoried. And he
          has very large powers and interests conferred on him by law; being
          the representative of the deceased, and having the same property in
          his goods as the principal had when living, and the same remedies to
          recover them.
        </li>
        <li>
          He must pay the debts of the deceased. This includes funeral charges
          and legal fees
        </li>
        <li>
          Once all the debts are paid, he must pay the legacies, which is a
          gift of goods and chattels by testament
        </li>
        <li>
          Once all the specific legacies are paid, any surplus is paid to the
          residuary legatee, if specified. Otherwise, the surplus goes to the
          executor. But if there is enough reason to justify that the testator
          did not intend for the executor to have the surplus, it shall go to
          the next of kin
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So an executor or administrator is kind of like a trustee, and the
        beneficiaries are various people like creditors or people who the
        deceased has left things for.

      <p>
        These first two books were not what I expected. They were both
        foundational and simple yet profound and complex. Not only did they
        cover fundamental topics such as owning things or natural rights and
        relations between people, but through the explanation of details,
        illustrated a wonderful reasoning and logic behind every law.

        I would love to read the next two books on wrongs (the first two books
        were on rights) but I’m afraid I will have to postpone that for a
        later time. I think these first two books gave me enough of the
        foundation I wanted to study what I actually wanted to study. I also
        didn’t absorb 100% of the information from these first two books but I
        think I’ll be okay without re-reading them a second time. Anyways.
        Ciao!
