    The US empire is bankrupt - we hear that all the time nowadays online.
  But what does that really mean?
   </p>
   <h1>
    The money is gone
   </h1>
   <p>
    The Social Security Trust Fund apparently "invests" 100% of it's
  leftover funds into Treasuries. Which really means that the US
  government has looted the Social Security Trust Fund and left it with
  fiat IOUs. The fiat IOUs will slowly be paid back, of course. But with
  printed, devalued money.
   </p>
   <p>
    The banks have Treasuries. Can you imagine? The US government has
  looted the banks. There are 17 trillion dollars worth of deposits but
  they're backed by toilet paper fiat IOUs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Who else owns Treasuries? Pensions. 401k savers. University
  endowments. Sovereign wealth funds. High-net worth asset managers.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the US, also owns a bunch of
  Treasuries and debt that it can't liquidate because there's no demand
  for it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Point is, there's no more money in the coffers, and there's no money
  anywhere to be seen - everyone's savings, stored in social security,
  401ks, banks, and more - have been looted. China isn't going to lend
  to the US anymore. What does this all mean? It means that the US
  government needs to borrow money somehow, but there's no more places
  for the US government to borrow from!
   </p>
   <p>
    But wait... there's a "lender of last resort". Sound familiar?
   </p>
   <h1>
    Debt is too expensive
   </h1>
   <p>
    Without yield curve control, long-term interest rates are shooting
  higher. The US government simply can't afford to pay back debt, or
  rollover new debt, at these higher interest rates.
   </p>
   <p>
    So what will it do? It will implement yield curve control to
  artificially suppress interest rates and send money straight into the
  US Treasury's coffers.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a previous blog post about a Federal Reserve research paper on
  fiscal dominance, I covered how the US would immediately enter fiscal
  dominance at 2% real interest rates. As a refresher, here's ChatGPT's
  explanation for what fiscal dominance is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     "Fiscal dominance is a concept in economics and monetary policy
  that refers to a situation in which fiscal (government spending and
  taxation) policies exert a significant influence or control over
  monetary policies, including the conduct of a central bank. In such a
  scenario, the government's fiscal decisions and policies take
  precedence over the central bank's monetary policies."
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    We're far past the point of no return, in my opinion, and we will soon
  see a monetization of the fiscal budget through yield curve control.
   </p>
   <p>
    What does that mean? Don't hold cash, and don't hold debt! Instead,
  hold scarce assets that are scarce and will retain value, or will
  potentially be used as money such as Bitcoin.
