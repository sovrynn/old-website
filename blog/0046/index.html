  One of the things I want to implement in my life is not to be swept
  away by emotions and intelligently rationalize. Rather, I want to see
  reality for what it is. Never more than a first impression - wise
  words of Marcus Aurelius.
</p>
<p>
  On that thread, I will attempt to see the world for what it really is;
  not more than a first impression, when it comes to USD flows, and
  extrapolate on what it means for the US.
</p>
<h1>
  Current USD Overvaluation
</h1>
<p>
  When assessing the US fiscal situation, it can be tempting to simply
  think of the dollar-denominated proportions between debt, interest,
  revenue, and spending, at current dollar valuations. Then, the problem
  seems simple - get spending below income to begin to tread water! You
  have an income, you can start paying off debt, dealing with USD and
  Treasury dumping... anything is possible once you have an income.
</p>
<p>
  But really, the issue with that is imagining some kind of homeostasis
  at current dollar valuations. Really, the dollar is overvalued with a
  fat monetary premium due to its de facto use as money along with
  Treasuries in large swaths of the world.
</p>
<p>
  What happens when countries no longer wish to accept dollars for their
  goods or accumulate Treasuries as savings? Then, the US must acquire
  forex to actually pay for trade deficits. Which brings another factor
  into the equation. The US has approximately 65b per month, which is
  780b annualized, of trade deficits. However, currently these trade
  deficits don't cause inflation because foreigners simply accept and
  keep dollars and Treasuries as savings and money.
</p>
<p>
  Another important point is that US fiscal obligations shouldn't be
  measured in dollars, but rather, in goods and services. US obligations
  are really forex (metaphorically including, say, oil and food as
  forex) obligations to foreigners and constituents. The US has to
  import goods as part of its trade deficit, provide medical services,
  food, and shelter as welfare, and pay its soldiers in goods and
  services.
</p>
<p>
  With this more accurate mental model, we can consider what happens
  when the dollar devalues relative to goods and services, and incomes
  (including the government income) don't go up proportionally (Dollar
  devaluation could happen as a result of money creation, falling
  productivity, and shrinking dollar jurisdiction). When the dollar
  devalues and incomes don't go up proportionally, spending must fall.
  This could come in the form of nominal spending not keeping up with
  inflation, or continued currency devaluation via money printing, which
  achieves the same thing. Either way, the US fails to be able to pay
  its obligations measured in goods and services, and the system becomes
  weaker and weaker as it continues to default.
</p>
<p>
  All this doesn't need to result in hyperinflation, unless the money
  keeps getting printed and elevated levels of spending are attempted to
  be maintained. In Weimar Germany, money kept being printed to meet
  hard forex obligations. In the case of the US, we could see a large
  crash but eventually reach some sort of equilibrium, much like the
  British pound, albeit in a smaller currency jurisdiction with lower
  levels of spending. In such a case we would see high inflation but not
  hyperinflation unless the elites keep looting and mismanaging the
  system.
</p>
<h1>
  Detailed Number Crunching
</h1>
<p>
  With this nuanced view, the next question becomes, how far left do we
  have to fall? And this requires a more detailed analysis of flows.
</p>
<p>
  With:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    2 trillion fiscal deficit
  </li>
  <li>
    0.8 trillion trade deficit
  </li>
  <li>
    dedollarization in trade
  </li>
  <li>
    foreign holdings of dollars which can be dumped
  </li>
  <li>
    no more demand for Treasuries
  </li>
  <li>
    8t of Treasuries held by foreigners which can be dumped
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The supply-demand situation for the US dollar becomes extremely
  negative in terms of flows. Who wants to accumulate dollars and
  Treasuries as the US empire falls in a frenzy of money printing? Like
  all complex systems, I don't think anyone can say for certain how
  things will play out, but at the very least it seems the direction we
  are headed is down.
</p>
<p>
  Okay, but the US can just reduce spending right? Right? Well, take a
  look at the proportions between income and spending today in this
  simplified approximate model:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    US income of 4 trillion USD
  </li>
  <li>
    Spending of 6 trillion USD, including 0.8t forex denominated
    military, 4t forex denominated welfare, 1t nominally denominated
    interest
  </li>
  <li>
    Deficit of 2 trillion USD
  </li>
  <li>
    Nominally denominated debt of 34 trillion USD, of which 8t is held
    by foreigners (some is "owed" to the central bank)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To even begin to create a positive income and turn the situation
  around at current valuations, the US needs to spend 2 trillion less
  dollars per year. And that's just to go from deficit spending to
  having an income. Then it has a fat 34t pile of debt it needs to pay
  back with that positive income. 2t is a huge deficit - it needs to
  stop paying 50% of it's welfare, or its entire military and 33% of
  welfare, etc, any combination of which would mean a massive reduction
  of the system. Additionally this is all at current dollar valuations -
  debt and interest are dollar denominated, but military and welfare are
  forex denominated obligations because soldiers and constituents are
  paid in goods and services, not dollars. Finally, the interest
  payments will continue to increase because we only recently raised
  interest rates - either rates stay high and the interest payments will
  continue to balloon, or rates will go lower, reducing interest
  payments and inflating away debt but stoking inflation and worsening
  forex obligations. When combined with the aforementioned USD flows,
  it's clear that, barring extreme measures such as revolution or war,
  there's no way out; the current situation cannot be maintained.
</p>
<p>
  We are just in the early stages, measured in not log but linear scale,
  of dollar devaluation. Anecdotally inflation is higher but still
  manageable. There are still profit margins to cut into before
  businesses close up and stop producing things as demand dries up and
  people become poor. The shitshow will absolutely get much wowrse.
</p>
<h1>
  Visualizing a Weak Dollar Society
</h1>
<p>
  What are the butterfly effects of a devaluing dollar? Chiefly,
  everyone becomes poor, and everything else springs from that.
</p>
<p>
  As people become poor, the system won't have the demand to fund the
  same amount of production, or products will still be produced but they
  will be produced cheaply, paying low wages to their workers, and sold
  cheaply for smaller profit margins.
</p>
<p>
  Real profit margins of companies will go down and employees will be
  paid less and less. Much like so called third-world countries, people
  will have to work just as hard but for less pay.
</p>
<p>
  But it's not just the people that will become poor - the government
  will become poor, since the government's income is derived from the
  people. The US government won't be able to pay out so many goods and
  services as welfare and to its vast military. The country as a whole
  won't be able to afford so many imports.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, the standard of living of US citizens will go down.
</p>
<h1>
  Ending the Downtrend
</h1>
<p>
  Eventually, as the people and the government become more poor, the
  government will be forced to spend less and import less unless it
  continues printing into hyperinflation.
</p>
<p>
  As the currency devalues, exports will become competitive. The US
  won't eat all its food but export more and more. Its Apple employees
  won't get paid so much but other countries will enjoy importing Apple
  phones produced for cheaper labor and sold at cheaper prices. America
  will build a trade surplus, and as a nation finally have an income
  instead of having trade deficits funded with debt.
</p>
<p>
  One thorn in this scenario is that this dynamic of cheaper exports
  only happens when US currency devalues not just in real terms but in
  comparison to other countries' similarly depreciating fiat currencies.
  Remember that normies in other countries are also becoming
  impoverished since they have fiat currencies which are mostly managed
  even worse than the dollar and, just like American citizens, are
  paying 90% tax rates over long timeframes.
</p>
<p>
  The USD must devalue a lot to become cheaper to people with even
  shittier forex. The masses are impoverished from cantillionaire money
  printing, the nations are impoverished from mismanagement of their
  economies, and in order for the US to become export competitive, it'll
  have to outpace other fiat currencies in their mismanaged currency
  devaluations.
</p>
<h1>
  The Ultimate Fate of the Dollar
</h1>
<p>
  The ultimate fate of the dollar is just another shitty fiat currency.
  Westerners think of the dollar as money and like to measure the world
  in it. But would we ever measure our trade deficits and national
  income in Argentinian pesos or Zimbabwe dollars? Absolutely not.
</p>
<p>
  But in the future, for most of the world - pretty much anyone who's
  not a US citizen - measuring anything in US dollars will become,
  qualitatively, just as ridiculous as measuring anything in Zimbabwe
  dollars.
</p>
<h1>
  Wen Crash?
</h1>
<p>
  It will take time. We are just in the beginning stages. It could take
  a decade to play out, or even more. Particularly, dedollarization is
  gaining some steam but I don't see it happening in Western European
  countries nor in Latin America, at least not yet. Dollar dominance and
  dogshit fiat currency in Latin America is still going strong. The
  American empire has a lot of buffer room.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, the current American state might not be in one piece by the
  end of it all. That would make the dollar crisis even worse, and make
  its eventual jurisdiction even smaller. Let's see how it turns out.
</p>
<p>
  What I do believe is that eventually, the American homeland, with its
  great natural resources, land, and people, will make it out a new
  country, by the people and for the people, with hardworking
  constituents, high productivity, and excellent finances. It's simply
  that there may be a painful transition period in between.
