        I repeatedly find that much time can be saved, effort conserved, and
        wisdom gained by going straight to the source. The Internet has
        allowed for a great deal of information to be shared but it turns out,
        much of it is simply noise, or at best, a noisy rehash of what the
        great thinkers have produced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitcoin, as it turns out, is no different. And for the source of
        Bitcoin, how much closer can we get to it than the words of its
        creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, and the discussions he had with curious
        observers in Bitcoin's earliest days?
      </p>
      <p>
        In this blog post, I want to talk about "Mises' Regression Theorem",
        which provides a mathematical framework for understanding money and
        its origins. Seeing something so seemingly complex as money be so
        elegantly modeled in just a single mathematical abstraction made me
        truly admire the power of abstract logic and reasoning, of which math
        is simply a manifestation.

        Mises' Regression Theorem original Bitcoin discussion thread
      </h1>
      <p>
        It all began with the
        <a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/">
          earliest records of Satoshi's discussions</a>, and eventually,
        <a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/threads/137/">
          this specific thread on Mises' Regression Theorem</a>, and how
        Bitcoin does not violate it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"...a money price at the end of day X is determined by the marginal
        utilities of money and the good as they existed at the beginning of
        day X. But the marginal utility of money is based, as we have seen
        above, on a previously existing array of money prices. Money is
        demanded and considered useful because of its already existing money
        prices. Therefore, the price of a good on day X is determined by the
        marginal utility of the good on day X and the marginal utility of
        money on day X, which last in turn depends on the prices of goods on
        day X \u0096 1. The economic analysis of money prices is therefore not
        circular. If prices today depend on the marginal utility of money
        today, the latter is dependent on money prices yesterday."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Very simple - the price of money on any given day is dependent on the
        price of money the day before.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Rothbard then goes on to explain that in order for money to emerge
        from a barter economy, it must have a preexisting commodity value.
        This commodity value arises from barter demand for the potential money
        in direct consumption (i.e. ornamentation). This value seeds future
        estimations of the value of the money as a medium of exchange. The
        natural market emergence of money is thus fully explained."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        A wonderful explanation for the natural market emergence of
        commodity-based money from a barter economy where one commodity
        eventually emerges as the dominant money.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"However, once an economy has been monetized and a memory of price
        ratios for goods and services has been established, a money may lose
        its direct commodity value and still be used as a money (medium of
        indirect exchange)."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"On the other hand, it does not follow from this analysis that if
        an extant money were to lose its direct uses, it could no longer be
        used as money. Thus, if gold, after being established as money, were
        suddenly to lose its value in ornaments or industrial uses, it would
        not necessarily lose its character as a money. Once a medium of
        exchange has been established as a money, money prices continue to be
        set. If on day X gold loses its direct uses, there will still be
        previously existing money prices that had been established on day X
        \u0096 1, and these prices form the basis for the marginal utility of
        gold on day X. Similarly, the money prices thereby determined on day X
        form the basis for the marginal utility of money on day X + 1. From X
        on, gold could be demanded for its exchange value alone, and not at
        all for its direct use. Therefore, while it is absolutely necessary
        that a money originate as a commodity with direct uses, it is not
        absolutely necessary that the direct uses continue after the money has
        been established."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Rothbard, the author quoted in the thread, notes that a medium of
        exchange may lose its direct commodity value and still be used as a
        medium of exchange. Rothbard denotes such a money as a "medium of
        indirect exchange".
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"This explains the history of fiat currencies. They originally
        started off as simple names for weights of commodity money (silver)
        that developed out of the pre-monetary barter economy. Despite later
        losing their ties to direct commodity value through state
        interference, paper currency retained status as money because of
        memory of previous money prices. This factor is so strong that the
        relationship between gold and the USD, for example, is somewhat
        inverted. Gold no longer circulates as a common medium of exchange.
        Prices are set in USD, not in gold. Most individuals wishing to trade
        in gold do so based on their knowledge of USD/gold price ratios.
        ("Hey, let me buy that $100 couch from you in gold?" "Ok, USD/gold is
        $1000/oz. Give me 1/10oz of gold.") Legal tender laws, state taxation,
        and the entire financial regulatory environment maintain this inertia
        of USD prices and make it challenging to return to gold money
        directly, despite the destructive inflationary nature of fiat
        currencies."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuity is powerful. Fiat currency is one of the best examples of
        this - people continue to use green pieces of paper as money even
        after it ceased to be backed by gold, which is the actual original
        money, simply out of custom, ease, and ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The essential point is that once exchange can occur between a
        money (USD) and Bitcoins, providers of goods have a means by which to
        value Bitcoins as a potential medium of exchange. The money regression
        is satisfied, because taken back far enough we reach traditional
        commodity money: BITCOINS -> USD -> MONETIZED GOLD & SILVER [start
        monetary economy] -> [end barter economy] COMMODITY GOLD &
        SILVER."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        The natural progression of money from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          commodity gold and silver (barter economy)
        </li>
        <li>
          gold and silver paper IOUs (monetary economy)
        </li>
        <li>
          paper
        </li>
        <li>
          Bitcoin
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        would thus be the expected progression of money.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I phrase it like that, it's truly incredible that people are
        using paper as money today. Historians will look back on this time
        period as a great anomaly in humanity's (temporary) departure from
        sound money.

      <h1>
        Daniel Krawisz' Take - "The Original Value of Bitcoins"
      </h1>
      <p>
        Daniel Krawisz, an OG Bitcoin blogger, has a
        <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-original-value-of-bitcoins/">
          take on Mises' Regression Theorem</a> that is worth reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The regression theorem addresses two separate issues: the
        emergence of a medium of exchange, and the evolution of a medium of
        exchange into money. A medium of exchange is defined to be something
        that is bought for the purpose of trading it for something else later.
        Money is the medium of exchange which is pre-eminent among all
        others."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        A succinct take on what a medium of exchange is, and that money is the
        most widely used medium of exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"As to the first issue, the explanation depends upon the
        observation that in order for something to be sold it must be treated
        as an economic good by both buyer and sellerâ€”meaning that they both
        would want some of it, even if they each are willing to pay different
        prices. If the buyer did not treat it as a good, then he would not be
        willing to pay for it, and if the seller did not treat it as a good,
        then he would be willing to give it away, or even pay to have it taken
        away. Since a medium of exchange is something which is bought and then
        resold, it must be treated as an economic good by both parties in both
        transactions."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Thus, the first person who is able to use a good as a medium of
        exchange must buy it from someone who also treats it as a goodâ€”yet who
        did not use it as a medium of exchange. Hence it follows that a thing
        becomes a medium of exchange on the basis of some other demand, and no
        other evolution is possible."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        The birth of a medium of exchange based on market phenomena requires
        that someone else values the medium of exchange as an economic good
        (not solely as a medium of exchange) first.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The correct approach should have been clear to any Austrian
        economist, but until recently, Austrian analyses of Bitcoin have been
        superficial. It is not yet generally understood among Austrians that
        Bitcoin is fundamentally different from both gold and fiat currencies,
        and therefore requires a fundamental analysis going back to first
        principles. This may have to be reiterated a few more times before the
        Austrian movement is convinced."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Going back to first principles is required to appreciate what Bitcoin
        is achieving and could potentially be. You cannot simply look at
        history and parrot that gold has always been used as sound money and
        thus always will be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The correct approach, I think, was hinted at by Å urda, who
        obliquely says, "According to my opinion, the rational expectations of
        the potential utility of Bitcoin for the potential buyers exceeded the
        price demanded by the producers, and trade emerged".10 Bitcoins would
        have had value to the person with the right entrepreneurial
        mindset."</i>

        explained.

        reality."</i> - Daniel Krawisz.
