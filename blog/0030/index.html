        The Federal Reserve recently published a research paper on the fiscal
        and monetary situation of the US titled
        <a href="https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/2023/06/02/fiscal-dominance-and-the-return-of-zero-interest-bank-reserve-requirements.pdf">
          Fiscal Dominance and the Return of Zero-Interest Bank Reserve
          Requirements</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper essentially says:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The US has too much debt and spends too much money
        </li>
        <li>
          The US is going to print tons of money, leading to an inflationary
          spiral and eventually hyperinflation
        </li>
        <li>
          The US is going to implement capital controls on banks and prevent
          people from withdrawing their money
        </li>
        <li>
          The US is going to force banks to sell lots of assets to hold cash
        </li>
        <li>
          Banks, mutual funds, pensions funds, and other financial
          institutions are going to go bankrupt, leading to a global financial
          crisis
        </li>
        <li>
          The US is going to have to choose between stopping government
          benefits like Social Security / Medicare and financial collapse
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've provided quotes from the research paper along with my
        plain-English translations. There is a lot of financial lingo you have
        to read between the lines to understand.

        Abstract
      </h1>
      <p>
        <i>"As a matter of arithmetic, the trends of US government debt and
        deficits will eventually result in an outrageously high government
        debt-to-GDP ratio. But when exactly will the United States hit the
        constraint of infeasibility and how exactly will policy adjust to it?
        This article considers fiscal dominance, which is the possibility that
        accumulating government debt and deficits can produce increases in
        inflation that “dominate” central bank intentions to keep inflation
        low. Is it a serious possibility for the United States in the near
        future? And how might various policies change (especially those
        related to the banking system) if fiscal dominance became a
        reality?"</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: The US fiscal situation is unsustainable. But when
        exactly will it all collapse, with the US defaulting on all its debt?
        This article considers fiscal dominance, which refers to an
        inflationary debt spiral, culminating in hyperinflation. It could
        happen very soon. How could we possibly delay or prevent this?
      </p>
      <h1>
        Introduction
      </h1>
      <p>
        <i>"Indeed, if global real interest rates returned tomorrow to their
        historical average of roughly 2 percent, given the existing level of
        US government debt and large continuing projected deficits, the US
        would likely experience an immediate fiscal dominance problem."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: If the US was forced to pay a real interest rate of 2% on
        its future debt starting today, we would immediately enter an
        inflationary debt spiral.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Even if interest rates remain substantially below their historical
        average, if projected deficits occur as predicted, there is a
        significant possibility of a fiscal dominance problem within the next
        decade."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: We're probably going to enter an inflationary debt spiral
        in the next decade.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The essence of fiscal dominance is the need for the government to
        fund its deficits on the margin with non-interest-bearing debts. The
        use of non-interest-bearing debt as a means of funding is also known
        as “inflation taxation.” Fiscal dominance leads governments to rely on
        inflation taxation by “printing money” (increasing the supply of
        non-interest-bearing government debt)."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: The key part of an inflationary debt spiral is the need
        for the government to finance itself by printing money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thoughts: "Non-interest-bearing-debt" is doublespeak, because who in
        their right mind (I suppose this mindset is contrary to riba/usury)
        would lend you money without charging interest? Additionally, "debt"
        is only debt if you actually intend to pay it back. If you don't
        intend to pay it back, it really just means taking money from someone
        else and never returning it. So combining these two facts, we should
        interpret "non-interest-bearing-debt" to really mean "stolen money".
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"As the money supply is forced to grow by fiscal dominance,
        inflation rises, which creates a new means of funding government
        expenditures via “inflation taxation.” Inflation taxation has two
        components: expected and unexpected inflation taxation. Both are
        limited in their ability to fund real government expenditures."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: When money is printed, inflation rises and governments
        are able to pay for stuff. The value of what the government spends
        consists of two parts - "expected" and "unexpected" inflation
        taxation. Both are not unlimited resources (obviously).
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The expected component of inflation taxation (per period) is the
        product of the nominal interest rate and the inflation tax base, which
        consists of all non-interest bearing government debt. (Typically, this
        consists of currency and non-interest-bearing bank reserves at the
        central bank.) Total real government expenditures that can be financed
        by the expected inflation tax are limited because the tax base of this
        inflation tax is determined by the demand for money. The inflation tax
        earned per period is the product of the nominal interest rate (the
        inflation tax rate) and the amount of real demand for currency and
        zero-interest reserves."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: The obvious part of inflation taxation is when
        cash-holders are diluted by inflation. This part of inflation taxation
        is limited because only people who need to use cash (or fools) would
        hold cash when they know they are losing money by holding it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thoughts: The sober categorization of currency as non-interest bearing
        government debt is duly noted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Unexpected inflation taxation occurs when the nominal value of
        outstanding government debt falls unexpectedly (thereby taxing
        government debtholders), and this component is also limited by the
        ability of government to surprise markets by creating unanticipated
        inflation."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This part is somewhat confusing and took me quite a bit to fully
        understand. Let me do my best to explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The non-obvious part of inflation taxation is when the US government
        "surprises" government debtholders by simultaneously:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          inflating the money supply by printing more money and creating more
          debt
        </li>
        <li>
          unexpectedly devaluing, in dollar terms, the government debt that
          existing bondholders have
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bonds get devalued when the inflation rate of money unexpectedly
        rises.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has to be a SURPRISE devaluation because if it isn't, it would be
        priced in already and no one would be "losing money". If bondholders
        knew a devaluation was coming, they would have either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          demanded higher interest rates on the debt
        </li>
        <li>
          bought it at a lower price to begin with
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This part of inflation taxation is limited because the government can
        only surprise the market so many times before the market learns to
        predict that the US government is likely to continue doing this and
        prices it in on future bond purchases, ultimately refusing to buy any
        more debt.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the government does it once, it's essentially a soft default on
        the debt. Another way to look at it is that the government scams bond
        purchasers by selling the bond at an overinflated price which doesn't
        price in future money printing. Later, when the government prints
        money, the bond is devalued and the bond purchaser is left with an
        asset that is worth less than what he bought it for.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"If the US government faced a fiscal dominance problem, it would
        have to fund real deficits by real inflation taxation, which is a
        limited tax resource. Thus, not all real deficits are feasible to fund
        with inflation taxation."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: You can't keep funding yourself by printing money forever
        because the real value you can extract from the market by printing
        money is limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Furthermore, some changes in policy with respect to reserve
        requirements are likely if fiscal dominance becomes a reality. The
        existing amount of the zero-interest debt (the inflation tax base) is
        currently limited to only currency, given that bank reserves bear
        interest today. Given the small size of the currency outstanding, if
        the government wishes to fund large real deficits, that will be easier
        to do if the government eliminates the payment of interest on
        reserves. This potential policy change implies a major shock to the
        profits of the banking system."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: The US government is broke. In order to slow the
        inflationary spiral, it will implicitly default on some of its debt to
        the banking system by no longer paying the banks interest on bank
        reserves. This interest happens to be a large part of bank cash flows.
        TLDR the US government is going to rug the private banking sector by
        cutting off a large part of their cash flows.
      </p>
      <p>
        The theoretically rigorous way of understanding this quote is that
        stopping interest payments on bank reserves recategorizes the reserves
        from interest-bearing government debt to non-interest bearing
        government debt, which is cash. Increasing the cash base allows the
        government to extract more value via inflation taxation, allowing the
        government to fund larger deficits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Second, as the history of inflation episodes has shown, even an
        inflation tax base of currency plus zero-interest reserves would
        decline in real terms in the face of a significant increase in
        inflation. Based on data for the US as of 2023, the resulting
        inflation rate could be very high. (That rate is derived by
        calculating the inflation rate that, when multiplied by the inflation
        tax base, results in inflation taxation sufficient to fund projected
        deficits.)"</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: The described policy change of rugging the banking
        sector's cash flows won't even be that helpful because the large
        amount of money printing required to fund our very large deficits will
        quickly reduce the real value of our small inflation tax base.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"For that reason, it is quite possible that a fiscal dominance
        episode in the US would result in not only the end of the policy of
        paying interest on reserves, but also a return to requiring banks to
        hold a large fraction of their deposit liabilities as zero-interest
        reserves."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: Therefore, not only will we rug the revenues of the
        private banking sector, we will force the banking sector to rug the
        markets by selling a large portion of the assets on their balance
        sheet for cash.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially, it's a daisy chain of defaults and rugging that increases
        the amount of cash in the system that the government can then tax
        using inflation taxation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"...many people are unfamiliar with the concept of the inflation
        tax (especially in a society that has not lived under high inflation),
        they are not aware that they are actually paying it, which makes it
        very popular among politicians. If, as I argue below, a policy that
        would eliminate interest on reserves and require a substantial
        proportion of deposits to be held as reserves would substantially
        reduce inflation, then I believe it would be hard for the Federal
        Reserve Board to resist going along with that policy."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: This method of taxation is good because people don't even
        know we're taking their money when we take their money like this.
        Therefore, we recommend the US government to secretly take people's
        money like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Such a policy change would not only reduce bank profitability but
        also reduce the real return earned on bank deposits to substantially
        below other rates of return on liquid assets, which potentially could
        spur a new era of “financial disintermediation,” as consumers and
        firms seek alternatives to low-interest paying bank deposits."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: If we rug banks' cash flows and reduce their
        profitability, banks will have to reduce the interest rate they pay to
        depositors. This could lead to bank runs as people seek higher returns
        in other asset classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Of course, banks and their political allies might try to oppose
        financial innovations to allow firms and consumers to exit from banks,
        which would lead to a potentially interesting regulatory battle over
        the future of financial intermediation. The need to preserve a high
        inflation tax base could lead to a political choice to preserve a
        technologically backward banking system."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: We will likely have to implement capital controls on
        banks so that people are trapped into being unable to remove their
        money from our banks (so that we can keep taking their money).

        When does fiscal dominance become apparent as a constraint?
      </h1>
      <p>
        <i>"When exactly does fiscal dominance lead to monetization, and how
        much does that threaten monetary policy’s inflation goals? How much
        dollar inflation might result from excessive US government
        borrowing?"</i>
      </p>

        government money printing, and how does that reinforce the
        inflationary spiral? How much dollar inflation could be caused by
        excessive government debt?
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"...the total debt held by the public is limited by the present
        value of prospective future fiscal surpluses. At some point, as the
        government debt-to-GDP ratio rises sufficiently (for a given real
        interest rate and rate of real growth of the economy), the real demand
        for government debt reaches a maximum. Any issues of nominal debt
        beyond that amount will not be accepted by the bond market as
        increases in real debt."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: Total government debt is limited by the expected value of
        future government profits. When debt becomes too large relative to the

        government in real terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Where is the ceiling? If nominal GDP is $24 trillion, and current
        interest-bearing debt not held by government agencies or by the Fed is
        about $20 trillion, how much higher can the debt-to-GDP ratio go,
        given our current long-term real interest rate and real rate of
        growth?2 First, note that much of the Fed-held debt nowadays pays
        interest (whether through $3 trillion in excess reserves to Fed member
        banks or $2.4 trillion in Fed reverse repos mainly with money market
        mutual funds). If the Fed is paying interest on the debt, then this
        should be added to the Treasury debt held by the public."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: How much debt is too much? The US government has 20
        trillion of debt. Additionally, a lot of the Fed-held debt pays
        interest (5.4 trillion) and should thus be counted towards
        interest-paying debt. This makes the total interest-paying debt of the
        US government 25.4 trillion.
      </p>

        but the deficit has been running, and is projected to continuing
        running, at greater than 5 percent of GDP per year. CBO projections
        imply that the debt-to-GDP ratio will reach about 200 percent by 2050,
        but that assumes that real interest rates will remain at their
        historical lows; if they rise even by a small amount, the implied debt
        growth scenario is much worse."</i>

        War II. At current projections, US government debt will be twice the
        size of the economy by 2050, but if the market demands a higher
        interest rate than the historically low interest rates that we have
        today, it will be much worse.

        “printing money,” how would it do so and what are the limits to how
        much real government spending can be funded in this way? The real
        funding of spending from the “inflation tax” (the funding of its
        expenditures by printing money) is limited. There are two components

        has two parts - expected inflation tax and unexpected inflation tax.

        who hold cash or use it as money. This is limited because as inflation
        increases, the demand to use the money decreases. Eventually, once no
        more people are willing to hold cash, the government cannot buy real
        goods or services by printing money anymore.

        <i>"The government also may get another unexpected inflation tax
        related to the decline in the value of its outstanding bonds at the
        time the fiscal dominance problem arises. When fiscal dominance hits
        and leads to monetization, if this is not anticipated sufficiently far
        in advance, it also causes some or all existing bonds (long-term bonds
        with existing low coupons that aren’t indexed to inflation) to fall in
        nominal value. This is a one-time gain to the government because,
        going forward, the government will pay a market interest rate on all
        new debt issues that incorporates the future rate of inflation."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a beautiful little paragraph. Basically, when the government
        sells bonds and then surprise devalues them, they're essentially
        scamming people by selling bonds for more than they're worth. Each
        surprise devaluation yields a one-time gain because once the
        government does this, the market will price this new inflation rate
        into future bond purchases, paying less than they would otherwise for
        the same bond. More on bond pricing

        <i>"If the average duration of government debt is sufficiently long,
        and fiscal dominance is not anticipated years in advance, the
        government could benefit from a substantial capital gain from the
        unexpected inflation tax, which increases its real capacity to issue
        new interest-bearing debt by a similar amount."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: If the government sells long dated debt, and the market
        is foolish for years before the devaluation, the government can scam
        bondholders by selling lots of overvalued bonds over many years before
        finally devaluing them, extracting much more money from unsuspecting
        bondholders than it would have been able to otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"This assumes that the public does not see the fiscal dominance
        problem coming; but in today’s world, that does not seem as
        far-fetched an assumption as it used to be. Still, the ability to
        surprise the market with an acceleration of inflation is always
        limited by the fact that market participants monitor political and
        economic news closely and have knowledge about the processes that give
        rise to inflation."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: We think bondholders today are foolish and and will let
        us extract lots of money from them because they aren't foreseeing the
        inevitable money printing that is coming. However, there are limits to
        this because market participants do have brains and monitor the market
        situation to some extent.

        <i>"It is also worth noting, as Beckworth (2023) points out, that in
        recent months the market value of US Treasury securities has already
        taken a toll on bondholders (including banks), declining from 108
        percent of GDP in 2020 to about 85 percent of GDP today, mainly as the
        result of inflation surprises since 2021. This unexpected inflation
        tax has already substantially expanded the ability of the government
        to issue debt. More surprises may be coming, although the ability to
        surprise savers will decline going forward: As the saying goes, you
        can’t fool all the people all the time."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: We are already extracting money from bondholders in
        recent months. In fact, we have already extracted significant amounts
        of money from bondholders, which will give us a supposed justification
        of printing more money under the guise of a "reasonable debt-to-GDP
        ratio". We are going to continue extracting money from bondholders,
        although eventually bondholders will wise up to the fact that we're
        scamming them.

        <i>"What does printing money mean in practical terms? For the US
        today, the “tax base” for the expected component of the inflation tax
        does not include the $3 trillion dollars of reserves held by banks—
        because those pay interest. Of course, the Federal Reserve could
        change that policy (and perhaps would have to do so in the event of a
        fiscal dominance problem); but if it did not do so, the inflation tax
        would be earned only on the dollars in cash held by the public
        worldwide (about $2.2 trillion in nominal terms today). The big
        questions about fiscal dominance problems for the US, therefore, are
        (1) how much would the government gain from surprising outstanding
        bondholders with fiscal dominance, (2) what would be the tax base of
        the expected inflation tax, and (3) how much would real demand for
        zero-interest cash fall (thereby reducing the real tax base of the
        expected inflation tax) as the result of an increase in expected
        inflation? Answering these questions is important because it tells us
        how much inflation would be needed for the government to be able to
        fund the fiscal costs not funded by interest-bearing debt (as a result
        of hitting the fiscal dominance threshold). Indeed, it is possible
        that when answering these questions one might even conclude that it is
        not feasible for the projected real fiscal deficits to be funded by
        the inflation tax. In that case, some cuts to governments spending or
        increases in other taxation would be necessary."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: There is only 2.2 trillion dollars in cash used
        worldwide, which is the tax base for the expected inflation tax.
        Therefore, we are going to have to print tons of money and completely
        default on our government debt. Even then, our tax base for the
        expected inflation tax (2.2 trillion) is going to shrink once
        inflation starts to increase, because once inflation starts to pick
        up, there will increasingly be less demand to hold and use that cash.
        Judging by all this, even if we print money and hyperinflate the
        dollar, we won't have enough money to fund our deficits. Therefore, we
        will have to reduce our spending or increase taxation in other ways.

        If the government printed money one time equal to 5% of total US
        government debt, the paper predicts:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Inflation of ~ 16% if the government stopped paying interest on bank
          reserves

        <li>
          Inflation of ~ 8.1% if the government stopped paying interest on
          bank reserves and forced banks to hold 40% of deposits in cash

        <li>
          Inflation of ~ 41% if the government did nothing
        </li>
      </ul>

        <i>"Given the powerful inflation reduction that a large reserve
        requirement would imply (in our example, a decline from 16 percent to
        8 percent), I think it is likely that a fiscal dominance shock would
        be accompanied by both the elimination of interest on reserves and a
        substantial reserve requirement (perhaps lower than 40 percent, but
        not so much lower that the implied rate of inflation would be
        permitted to rise too much)."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: We are going to print money, eliminate reserves, and
        force banks to sell a bunch of their assets for cash.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"If fiscal dominance results in a large increase in the reserve
        requirement, that means that the real shock to the profitability of
        the banking system would be greater than the shock related to the
        elimination of interest on reserves alone."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: If banks are forced to sell a bunch of their assets for
        cash, we are going to have a mass market meltdown and a ton of banks
        are going to go bankrupt because their balance sheets will be
        compromised.

        Conclusions
      </h1>
      <p>
        <i>"As the result of the high current US government debt-to-GDP ratio
        and continuing projected deficits, we face a possible dollar inflation
        uncertainty nightmare: Continuing deficits, if unchecked, eventually
        will lead to a fiscal dominance problem. This problem seems likely,
        given the way Congress has behaved in recent years."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: We have too much debt, spend more than we earn, and have
        political issues in Congress, so now we're going to have to print tons
        of money.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"A significant rise in long-run real interest rates also seems
        quite possible, given that the three decades of decline in real
        interest rates are poorly understood and may reflect temporary
        demographic influences. Such an environment would hasten the
        triggering of a fiscal dominance problem, leading to a messy
        monetization in the US, with ramifications worldwide."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: Bond markets are going to dump and real bond demand will
        only exist at significantly higher interest rates. This would force
        the US to print tons of money and buy debt securities, causing a
        global financial crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Many things would likely change in a fiscal dominance scenario to
        make the inflation tax base larger to facilitate the funding of
        continuing deficits with less of a rise in inflation. Interest on
        reserves would likely be eliminated—otherwise, monetization would do
        little to relax the constraint on the government. Inflation would
        rise, potentially by a large amount, if that is the only policy used
        to create inflation taxation. If the elimination of interest on
        reserves were accompanied by a new large reserve requirement,
        inflationary consequences could be much lower."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: We are going to squeeze the private banking sector's cash
        flows, and force banks to sell assets and hold a bunch of cash.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"If the bond market does not anticipate a fiscal dominance shock
        sufficiently far in advance (where the definition of “sufficiently
        far” is determined by the duration of bonds held by the public), then
        bond investors would be caught with losses on high-duration bonds. All
        of these changes imply that the effects on banks and mutual funds and
        pension funds and others would be potentially quite dramatic."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: If bond holders don't get out of the market now while
        they still can, bond holders are going to lose lots of money. Banks,
        mutual funds, pensions funds, and other financial institutions are
        going to go bankrupt.

      <p>
        <i>"In the 1970s and 1980s, major financial disintermediation from
        banks accompanied the rise in inflation taxation because rising
        inflation reduced the real rate earned on bank deposits. Similar
        pressures to disintermediate banks could rise again as the result of a
        rise in inflation taxation. If that occurs, however, banks and their
        political allies will redouble their efforts to use regulation to
        protect the banking system from innovation and competition, as they
        have already been doing (see Calomiris, 2021)."</i>

        My personal closing thoughts
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's refreshing to see it all laid out like this. As non-insiders,
        this is as close to the truth we're going to get.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some musings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The rate of debt dilution MUST be higher than the nominal interest
          paid on debt, in order to provide an incentive for people to hold
          that debt
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The truth is, the US has already been in fiscal dominance for a long
        time, AT LEAST since the 2008 GFC. This research report is simply a
        sober and politically correct recognition of the undeniable reality of
        what's coming and already here, by many measures. There is just too
        much debt held by the government and the public, and it all started
        from the parasitic bankers who stole and continue to steal from the
        people by creating money out of thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are past the point of no return. Buckle up!
