  TLDR Bitcoin is a promising, growing and equal-right Ponzi scheme that will likely
  leave the world a better place than today if it succeeds in dethroning
  the rotting fiat Ponzi scheme and humanity doesn't get wiped out by a
  geophysical cataclysm.
</p>
<h1>
  Money is inherently a Ponzi scheme
</h1>
<p>
  A Ponzi scheme is defined as (abridged):
</p>
<p>
  <i>"A Ponzi scheme lures investors and pays profits to earlier
  investors with funds from more recent investors."</i>
</p>
<p>
  Bitcoin, by that definition, is a Ponzi scheme.
</p>
<p>
  Guess what - fiat currency (debt) is also a Ponzi scheme. Debt
  ("bonds", IOUs) itself is a ponzi scheme. Financial "assets" (debt)
  are ponzi schemes. What is debt? Debt is a promise of payment in the
  future. All money is debt, including Bitcoin, and it's also a Ponzi
  scheme.
</p>
<p>
  Fiat currency is a dying, rotting, Ponzi scheme where certain
  individuals have unilateral privileges to profit from seignorage.
</p>
<p>
  Bitcoin is a growing Ponzi scheme that offers equal rights to all
  participants and has the power to dethrone the fiat currency Ponzi
  schemes in the marketplace of money Ponzi schemes.
</p>
<p>
  Why? It's just better. No one can unilaterally create more Bitcoin for
  free (seigniorage). It's border-agnostic. It doesn't have to jump
  through centralized fence-hoops. It's self-custodial. You don't have
  to pay fees to shareholders of the system as a percentage of your
  transfered money. All the pro-Bitcoin narratives are indeed true.
</p>
<p>
  Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme that has a genuine power to improve the
  world, and behind it, are many motivated individuals fighting for a
  great cause, a better future, and personal gain - a powerful cocktail.
</p>
<h1>
  Can I just sit on Bitcoin and wait for the world to become amazing?
</h1>
<p>
  No. Bitcoin alone is insufficient. Be prepared to fight and go to war
  over Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only succeed through the collective power of
  determined people.
</p>
<h1>
  Is the Final Parabola (my old Bitcoin thesis) still possible?
</h1>
<p>
  Yes, in some future timelines, we are still on track for a legitimate
  dollar price of infinite dollars per Bitcoin - in other words, a world
  where dollars will be completely worthless, and no amount of dollars
  will be exchangeable for any Bitcoin (except perhaps as firewood or
  recycled paper). This will occur when all people worldwide cease to
  use the dollar as a store of value and medium of exchange, and instead
  use Bitcoin.
</p>
<h1>
  Cataclysmic Considerations
</h1>
<p>
  In a geophysical cataclysm, money becomes worthless, since money's
  worth is in part based on future production. The only reason you hold
  money today is because you expect to be able to exchange it for
  something valuable in the future. If you don't expect there to be much
  or any abundance of valuable "things" in the future, then money
  becomes worthless.
</p>
<h1>
  Money has no intrinsic value
</h1>
<p>
  Money is worthless by itself.
</p>
<p>
  What has value is people, stuff, products, services, etc. Money is
  only useful so long as people are willing to give you their valuable
  stuff in exchange for it, in the hopes that they themselves will then
  be able to do the same in the future.
</p>
<p>
  Humans could live without money. They just have to drop the money and
  grow food, build shelters, work hard, trust each other, and so on
  everyday.
</p>
<p>
  Money should simply be a means to an end - a tool to help you have a
  good death, achieve a dream, complete a project, do something
  important. It should not be the focus of anyone's life.
</p>
<h1>
  Money is a giant Ponzi scheme and today, a tool of enslavement
</h1>
<p>
  Yes, you have been convinced to sit quietly and harmlessly and
  exchange all your labor, time, effort, and stuff for pieces of paper
  and/or bits in someone else's computer, produced at effectively 0
  cost.
</p>
<p>
  Look around you. You are a free human being. You can do whatever you
  want. That filthy green piece of paper in your hand? You can toss it
  into the sewer (where it belongs) and nothing around you, including
  yourself, will change. Actually, the palm of your hand won't have
  filth on it anymore.

  A Potential Future: History of the 2000 CE Ancient Silicon Age
  Trans-Atlantic Empire's End-Times (Written 5000 CE by Junho):
</h1>
<p>
  <i>"In the decades before the cataclysm, the masses, who'd been
  hoodwinked by the magic word spells of law, order, money, and pacifist
  liberalism, stood idly by, entranced, as their labor and resources
  continued to be taken away in front of their blind, unsuspecting eyes.
  "It is ours", the collectors said, "this is the law", as the masses
  handed over their earnings into the collectors' outstretched
  hands."</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"Those receiving the tributes and controlling the money printers of
  the proles used these money spells to extract all the resources from
  the land and prepare their own secret hideouts. When the cataclysm
  came, the proles were left to perish helplessly on the surface, as
  they were viewed as naught more than that. The proles couldn't realize
  that all they needed to do to survive was to collectively stand up,
  organize themselves, and take back what was rightfully theirs in the
  years before the cataclysm, by the natural laws and order of Earth
  itself, and by their inalienable powers to reshape the world bestowed
  upon them by their Creator."</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>"Instead, in their failure to organize under a common cause, and to
  see what was occurring before their very eyes and under their feet,
  they chose to remain captured by the spells of money and liberalism
  till the very end, perishing after working as cattle for generations.
  Today, they remain eternal examples of what once was, as fossils under
  the sea, along with their civilization. Oh, what could've been."</i>
