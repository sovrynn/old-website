Repo for my personal website.

TODO:
- improve generator
    - add nested and numbered lists
    - find some markdown -> HTML library
- figure out how to change formatting for mobile (media selector width > height?)
- if I could just have my folders of markdown files and then autogenerate all the navbar and blog pages that would be wonderful
- better directory structure so the links are nicer. React could solve that potentially
- Would like to be able to reuse components such as the navbar while only defining them once. Would also help me modify the navbar more easily. Probably the best way to do that is using some front-end framework
- Google analytics
- Better font/spacing
- Dark theme toggle

Fixed issues:
- Formatting issue where `<p>` and `<ul>` that don't span multiple lines have smaller font size on mobile (fixed by adding some mobile formatting meta-parameters)
